Exploring the nature of cumulativity through sound symbolism: Experimental studies of Pokémonastics with English speakers,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005243/current.pdf?_s=ZXBGafpbo8W1-oRQ,"['Kawahara, Shigeto', 'Breiss, Canaan']","There has been a dramatic rise of interest in sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. Despite this, one aspect that is still markedly under-explored is its cumulative nature, i.e., when there are two or more sounds with the same symbolic meaning, whether these effects add up or not. These questions are important to address, since they bear on the general question of how speakers take into account multiple sources of evidence when they make linguistic decisions. Inspired by an accumulating body of research on cumulativity in other linguistic patterns, two experiments on sound symbolism using Pokémon names were conducted with native speakers of English. The experiments tested two types of cumulativity: counting cumulativity, which holds if the effects of multiple instances of the same factor add up, and ganging-up cumulativity, which holds when the effects of different factors add up. The experiments addressed whether these patterns of cumulativity hold in sound symbolism, and, more importantly, if so, how. We found that (1) three factors can show ganging-up cumulativity, (2) counting cumulativity and ganging-up cumulativity can coexist in a single system (3) ganging-up cumulativity patterns can plausibly be considered to be linear, and (4) counting cumulativity effects can be sub-linear.","['cumulativity', 'sound symbolism', 'pokémonastics', 'voicing', 'the iconicity of quantity', 'phonology']",2020
A wug-shaped curve in sound symbolism: The case of Japanese Pokémon names,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005382/current.pdf?_s=gifNKMd3FuUNDf4T,"['Kawahara, Shigeto']","Whether linguistic patterns show cumulative effects or not is an issue that is currently debated in contemporary phonological studies. This paper attempts to shed new light on this debate from a novel perspective by studying sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. The current experiment shows that when Japanese speakers judge Pokémons’ evolution status based on nonce names, the judgments are affected both by their mora count and the presence of a voiced obstruent. The effects of mora count instantiate a case of counting cumulativity, while the interaction between these two factors instantiates ganging-up cumulativity. These two cumulative patterns observed in the current experiment together result in what Hayes (2020) refers to as “wug-shaped curves,” a quantitative signature predicted by MaxEnt. The paper shows that the experimental results can indeed be successfully modeled using MaxEnt, equipped with the sort of phonological constraints that have been used in the Optimality Theoretic research. I also examine Stochastic Optimality Theory in light of the current experimental results and show that this theory faces an interesting set of challenges. Finally, in this paper I make a novel methodological proposal for general phonological inquiry and sound symbolism research. The current study was inspired by Hayes (2020), a proposal made within formal phonology. The experiment ended up revealing important, hitherto understudied aspects of sound symbolism, and in turn, it revealed how cumulativity manifests itself in linguistic patterns. The current exploration thus shows by way of a case study that formal phonology and research on sound symbolism can mutually inform one another.

Bootstrapping Sound Changes,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004299/current.pdf?_s=66EEFH1kuVm2Nohr,"['Begus, Gasper']","This paper presents a technique for estimating the influences of channel bias on phonological typology. The technique based on statistical bootstrapping enables the estimation of Historical Probability, the probability that a synchronic alternation arises based on two diachronic factors -- the number of sound changes required for an alternation to arise and their respective probabilities. We estimate Historical Probabilities of six attested and unattested alternations targeting feature [voice], compare Historical Probabilities of these alternations, perform inferential statistics on the comparison, and compare outputs of the diachronic model against the independently observed synchronic typology to evaluate the performance of the channel bia approach. The proposed technique also identies mismatches in typological predictions of the analytic bias and channel bias approaches. By comparing these mismatches with the observed typology, this paper attempts to quantitatively evaluate the distinct contributions of the two influences on typology in a set of alternations targeting feature [voice].","['historical phonology', 'sound change', 'bootstrapping', 'learnability', 'typology', 'phonology']",2020
On Sound-Meaning Correlation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005472/current.pdf?_s=QRZcdToFCihZA6Uv,"['Mukherji, Nirmalangshu']","The intriguing fact about human language is that neither the sound systems nor the thought systems--technically called Sensorimotor and Conceptual-intentional systems--have any significant precedence prior to the emergence of the hominid line. So, a theory of language needs to explain where they came from and how they fell into place to create the conditions for unbounded generativity. In effect, language-theory needs to explain two novel factors in the evolution of human language: word-formation and word-combination. In this context, the recent proposal that the sound component of language is 'ancillary', and that language is basically designed for thought, is problematic. This is because the proposal turns the origin of the rich structure of human thought into a mystery since the units of human thought could not have been borrowed from, say, the apes. To look for an alternative explanation, we study Darwin's idea that (a) the sound system might have evolved in part from a pre-existing human music system, (b) the evolving sound systems might have 'acted on' rudimentary units of thought systems to turn them into words. We critically evaluate Darwin's picture. In the process, we locate the gaps in Darwin's story that must be filled to reach a more complete theory of language.","['language evolution', 'sound system', 'sound ancillary hypothesis', 'thought system', 'generativity', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Artificial sound change: Language change and deep convolutional neural networks in iterative learning,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005558/current.pdf?_s=7YCYJjIsCZcL0S1w,"['Begus, Gasper']","This paper proposes a framework for modeling sound change that combines deep
convolutional neural networks and iterative learning. Acquisition and transmission of
speech across generations is modeled by training generations of Generative
Adversarial Networks on unannotated raw speech data. The paper argues that several
properties of sound change emerge from the proposed architecture. Generative
Adversarial Networks (Goodfellow et al. 2014, Donahue et al. 2019) are uniquely
appropriate for modeling language change because the networks are trained on raw
unsupervised acoustic data, contain no language-specific devices and, as argued in
Beguš (2020b), encode phonetic and phonological representations in their latent space
and generate innovative data that are linguistically highly informative. Four generations
of Generative Adversarial Networks were trained on an allophonic distribution in
English where voiceless stops are aspirated word-initially before stressed vowels except if preceded by [s]. The first generation of networks is trained on the relevant sequences in human speech from the TIMIT database. The subsequent generations are not trained on TIMIT, but on generated outputs from the previous generation and thus start learning from each other in an iterative learning task. The initial allophonic distribution is progressively being lost with each generation, likely due to pressures. from the global distribution of aspiration in the training data that resembles phonological pressures in natural language. The networks show signs of a gradual shift in phonetic targets characteristic of a gradual phonetic sound change. At endpoints, the networks' outputs superficially resemble a phonological change --- rule loss --- driven by imperfect learning. The model features signs of stability, one of the more challenging aspects of computational models of sound change. The results suggest that the proposed Generative Adversarial models of phonetic and phonological acquisition have the potential to yield new insights into the long-standing question of how to model language change.","['artificial intelligence', 'deep convolutional neural networks', 'generative adversarial networks', 'speech', 'phonetic learning', 'phonological learning', 'historical linguistics', 'sound change', 'phonology']",2020

A stripy wug-shaped curves in sound symbolism,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005476/current.pdf?_s=CdFT7Ud0nZIx1akp,"['Kawahara, Shigeto']","In recent years, Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar (MaxEnt HG) has been successfully applied to model various linguistic patterns. Building on these studies, the current experiment examines its quantitative signatures, typical probabilistic patterns that this framework is predicted to generate Hayes (2020). Given a linear scale of violations of one constraint, MaxEnt yields a sigmoid curve. When another constraint is relevant, this sigmoid curve can be shifted, yielding two sigmoid curves, which together look like a wug, our beloved animal in the linguistics community. When the second constraint can be violated more than once, MaxEnt predicts that it yields a set of multiple sigmoid curves separated from one another, resulting in a ""stripy wug-shaped curve."" The current experiment demonstrates that we observe a stripy wug-shaped curve in patterns of sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. Concretely, the experiment shows that the judgment of Pokémons' evolution status is cumulatively affected by the mora counts of nonce names, resulting in a sigmoid curve, and that this sigmoid curve can be shifted according to the number of voiced obstruents contained in the names. This paper concludes that MaxEnt HG is a useful framework to model sound-meaning mappings, and suggests that there may be a meaningful parallel between sound symbolic patterns and probabilistic phonological patterns.

Reduplication: A New Distributed Morphology Approach,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005292/current.pdf?_s=WI_M483uXsrU7CzB,"['Alqarni, Muteb']","The current paper aims to capture the properties of reduplication within the distributed morphology model (Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994; Embick and Noyer 2006; Siddiqi 2009; Embick 2010). Taking Standard Arabic (SA) as a representative, the article shows that SA, like many other languages, has both full and partial reduplication. Full reduplication repeats entire words or stems whereas partial reduplication doubles part of the stem. Rather than the available two analyses, i.e. the readjustment approach (Raimy 2000; Frampton 2009) and the affixation approach (Haugen 2008; Haugen and Harley 2010; Haugen 2011), the current paper provides a novel approach to the phenomenon of reduplication in the world languages. It argues that root consonants and vowels should be decomposed into non-phonetic distinctive features that undergo late insertion at PF. These non-phonetic distinctive features are supplied with sound items at PF in the same fashion that the terminal nodes with morphosyntactic features are fed with vocabulary items. This approach serves three purposes. It accounts for speech errors, captures the non-concatenative morphology in Semitic languages, and allows the reduplicant form to copy all the distinctive features of the roots, yielding instances of full reduplication. Instances of partial reduplication can be generated by root-sensitive impoverishment rules which target and delete some of the features of the stem or the reduplicant form.","['reduplication', 'standard arabic', 'distributed morphology', 'sound items', 'impoverishment rule', 'morphology']",2020
Do sibilants fly?

From modern perspectives, these statements can be understood as an assertion about sound symbolism, systematic connections between sounds and meanings. Inspired by these writers, this paper reports on an experiment which tests a sound symbolic value of sibilants. The experiment is a case study situated within the Pokémonastics research paradigm, in which researchers explore the sound symbolic patterns in natural languages using Pokémon names. The current experiment shows that when presented with pairs of a flying type Pokémon character and a normal type Pokémon character, Japanese speakers are more likely to associate the flying type Pokémons with names that contain sibilants than those names that do not contain sibilants. As was pointed out by Socrates, the sound symbolic connection identified in the experiment is likely to be grounded in the articulatory properties of sibilants---the large amount of oral airflow that accompanies the production of sibilants. Various implications of the current experiment for the sound symbolism research are discussed throughout the paper.","['phonetics', 'phonology', 'sound symbolism', 'pokémon', 'sibilants', 'type', 'flying', 'socrates', 'the upanishads', 'phonology']",2020
Playful speculations on how language might be and why there is functional material,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005085/current.pdf?_s=9cwiNwaJtHVYplcA,"['Arsenijevic, Boban']","Hierarchical constituent structures are a hallmark property of natural language. Traditional generative syntax either generates these structures solely in the module of syntax, as in main-stream generativism (Chomsky 1995), or different modules generate them in parallel (Kaplan and. Bresnan 1982, Jackendoff 1983). I argue that the source of hierarchical structure in language is a specific algorithm of knowledge retrieval and update. The procedure of information retrieval and update is domain-general, as it builds, maintains and retrieves general-purpose web-shaped knowledge representations. The way of operation of this component is such that its output consists in the type of hierarchical structures observed among linguistic constituents. These structures, representing segments from the knowledge representation, are mapped to and recovered from the phonological structure by a language specific mapping component. This view dispenses with the module of syntax, reducing the space between phonology and semantics to an algorithm mapping between hierarchical and linear structures. Illustrations are provided of the proposed structure of knowledge representation, of the mechanisms and outputs of the procedure of information retrieval and update, and of main operations involved in the mapping algorithm. It is shown how at a certain stage in the mapping, exactly structures attributed to linguistic expressions in generative grammar, in particular those argued for in Kayne (1994) and in cartographic approaches to syntax (Rizzi 1997, Cinque 1999, Cinque and Rizzi 2008), emerge, thus indicating that the proposed modification of the big picture does not significantly affect the empirical research into the meaning - constituency - word order interactions, or models provided to account for them. It is argued that the material in grammar identified as functional corresponds to those elements of knowledge representation which have priority in retrieval and a special role in the mapping algorithm, due to their universality and/or high frequency of occurrence. A discussion is provided of how this shift affects the architecture of grammar, as well as of some of the other general questions opened by the proposal.","['hierarchical structure', 'language architecture', 'sound-meaning mapping', 'semantics', 'syntax', 'functional material']",2020

This paper reviews major studies on sound symbolism and argues that sound symbolism can be an interesting topic of exploration for theoretical phonologists. This paper also demonstrates that insights gained by phonological research can shed light on some important issues in the studies of sound symbolism, and vice versa. Overall, I hope that this paper is informative for both theoretical phonologists and researchers who work on sound symbolism.","['sound symbolism', 'the phonetics-phonology interface', 'articulation', 'acoustics', 'cumulativity', 'language acquisition', 'the origin and evolution of languages', 'phonology']",2020
What voiced obstruents symbolically represent in Japanese: Evidence from the Pokémon universe,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005125/current.pdf?_s=aii4fimjn6GSYLsi,"['Kawahara, Shigeto', 'Kumagai, Gakuji']","Kawahara et al. (2018b) found that within the corpus of existing Pokémon names, the number of voiced obstruents in the characters’ names correlates positively with their weight, height, evolution levels and attack values. While later experimental studies to some extent confirmed the productivity of these sound symbolic relationships (e.g. Kawahara & Kumagai 2019a), they are limited, due to the fact that the visual images presented to the participants primarily differed with regard to evolution levels. The current experiment thus for the first time directly explored how each of these semantic dimensions---weight, height, evolution levels, and attack values---correlate with the number of voiced obstruents in nonce names. The results of two judgment experiments show that all of these parameters indeed correlate positively with the number of voiced obstruents in the names. Overall, the results show that a particular class of sounds---in our case a set of voiced obstruents---can signal different semantic meanings within a single language, supporting the pluripotentiality of sound symbolism (Winter et al., 2019). We also address another general issue that has been under-explored in the literature on sound symbolism; namely, its cumulative nature. In both of the experiments, we observe that two voiced obstruents evoke stronger images than one voiced obstruent, instantiating what is known as the counting cumulativity effect (Jäger & Rosenbach, 2006).","['sound symbolism', 'japanese', 'pokémon', 'cumulativity', 'pluripotentiality', 'phonetics', 'phonology']",2020

One general question that is currently explored is what sorts of semantic properties can be symbolically represented. Against this background, within the general research paradigm which explores the nature of sound symbolism using Pokémon names, several recent studies have shown that Japanese speakers associate certain classes of sounds with notions that are as complex as Pokémon types. Specifically, they associate (1) sibilants with the flying type, (2) voiced obstruents with the dark type, and (3) labials with the fairy type. These sound symbolic effects arguably have their roots in the phonetic properties of the sounds at issue, and are hence not expected to be specific to Japanese. The current study thus tested these sound symbolic associations with English speakers. Two experiments show that they can reliably make these three sound symbolic connections, similar to Japanese speakers. These results support the hypothesis advanced by Shih et al.

We present two experiments investigating sentences with co-speech sound effects and co-text emoji in lieu of gestures, revealing a remarkably similar projection pattern to that of co-speech gestures.

Specifically, we build on a series of studies conducted within a research paradigm called ""Pokémonastics,"" which uses the Pokémon universe to explore sound symbolic patterns in natural languages. Inspired by a study of existing English Pokémon names (Shih et al. 2018), two experiments were conducted in which native speakers of English were provided with pairs of pre-evolution and post-evolution Pokémon characters, the latter of which were always larger. The participants were given two name choices whose members were systematically different in some phonological properties. The results show the following sound symbolic patterns to be productive: (1) names with higher segment counts are more likely to be associated with post-evolution characters than names with lower segment counts, (2) names containing [a] are more likely to be associated with post-evolution characters than names containing [i], (3) names containing [u] are more likely to be associated with post-evolution characters than names containing [i], and (4) names containing coronals are more likely to be associated with post-evolution characters than names containing labials. Overall, the current results suggest that phonological considerations come into play when English speakers name new creatures.

Sound symbolic patterns in Pokémon move names,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003742/current.pdf?_s=8RjHA3mQU9Eeixxx,"['Kawahara, Shigeto']","In recent years, we have witnessed a dramatically growing interest in sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. A recent case study of sound symbolism shows that in Pokémon games, longer names are generally associated with stronger Pokémon characters, and moreover those Pokémon characters with names having more voiced obstruents are generally stronger (Kawahara et al., 2018b). The current study examined the productivity of these sound symbolic effects in the names of the moves that Pokémon creatures use when they battle. The analysis of the existing move names shows that the effect of name length on attack values is robust, and that the effect of voiced obstruents is tangible. These sound symbolic patterns hold, despite the fact that most (= 99%) move names are based on real words in Japanese. An additional experiment with nonce names shows that both of these effects are very robust. Overall, the current paper adds to the growing body of studies showing that the relationships between sounds and meanings are not as arbitrary as modern linguistic theories have standardly assumed. Uniquely, the current analysis of the existing move names shows that such non-arbitrary relationships can hold even when the set of words under consideration are mostly existing words (Shih & Rudin, 2019; Sidhu et al., 2019).

By pointing out a non-trivial parallel between sound symbolic connections and phonological mappings, I hope to show theoretical phonologists that studying sound symbolism can be interesting and informative. I also hope to show those researchers who study sound symbolism that an analytical device that theoretical linguists employ is useful in that it allows us to model an important aspect of sound symbolism. My ultimate goal is thus to enhance the communication between theoretical phonologists and researchers who work on sound symbolism who are not yet interested in theoretical phonology. The paper also has a descriptive value in that it summarizes various cases of cumulative effects in sound symbolic patterns from a variety of languages.

Interaction forces, derived from a simple model of the language learning process, are attractive at short range and repulsive at long range. This generates sets of acoustic clusters, each representing a distinct sound, which form patterns with similar statistical properties to real vowel systems. Our formulation may be generalised to account for spontaneous self actuating shifts in system structure which are observed in real languages, and to combine in one model two previously distinct theories of vowel system structure: dispersion theory, which assumes that vowel systems maximize contrasts between sounds, and quantal theory, according to which non linear relationships between articulatory and acoustic parameters are the source of patterns in sound inventories. By formulating the dynamics of vowel sounds using inter-particle forces, we also provide a simple unified description of the linguistic notion of push and pull dynamics in vowel systems.","['dispersion theory', 'vowel systems', 'quantal theory', 'typology', 'chain shifts', 'phonology']",2019

learning, memory, and social organization, the assumption of modularity can
also be an obstacle to understanding language at a deeper level.

two aspects of modeling work that receive relatively little attention: the formal mapping
from model to theory, and the scalability of demonstration models. A series of
implemented models of sound change are analyzed in this way. As theoretical inconsistencies
are discovered, possible solutions are proposed, incrementally constructing a
set of sufficient properties for a working model. Because internal theoretical consistency
is enforced, this model corresponds to an explanatorily adequate theory. And because
explicit links between modules are required, this is a theory, not only of sound change,

"How cute do I sound?: The iconic function of segmental alternation in Korean baby-talk register, Aegyo",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004857/current.pdf?_s=nuQyR5h8-5Fblz2a,"['Jang, Hayeun']","This paper presents the corpus and experimental studies of segmental alternation as strategies of the baby- talk register in Korean, Aegyo. Using a frequency analysis on Twitter and a cuteness-rating experiment, we address questions about the relationship between types of segmental alternation used in the Aegyo register and the iconic strength of Aegyo expressions. We find that the preference for Aegyo expressions and the degree of cuteness of Aegyo forms are determined by how natural the sound sequence resulting from the alternations was in Korean phonological structure. This suggests an interaction between the pure phonological constraints and the register-specific constraints in core grammar. We also find evidence that gender and age can be at play as a scaling factor of the register-specific constraints: older speakers and female speakers are more sensitive than are younger and male speakers to levels of cuteness in Aegyo expressions, depending on the segmental alternation used in the expressions. This is because the function of Aegyo register is to set up a special childlike persona of addressers in intimate relationship by rejecting mature language and intentionally speaking like a child.","['baby-talk speech register', 'iconic strength', 'segmental alternation', 'gender and age effects', 'phonology']",2019

Within this controlled universe, we compare the sound symbolisms of Pokémon names (pokemonikers) in six languages: Japanese, English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, and Russian.

In this paper, we explore a real-world dataset that parallels Pokémon, in which human players similarly have physical attributes of weight, height, and power: Major League Baseball. We investigated phonological correlations between baseball player statistics and their given first names, chosen baseball-official first names, and baseball nicknames. We found numerous sound symbolic associations in player-chosen names and nicknames, where conscious design plays a role in choosing a name that may communicate an attribute. These associations were often mediated by language-specific hypocoristic formation processes. We conclude that sound symbolism occurs in real-world naming practices, but only when names are chosen agentively in cognizance of the relevant attributes.","['sound symbolism', 'iconicity', 'names', 'onomastics', 'phonology', 'corpus linguistics', 'cognitive science', 'english', 'baseball', 'phonology']",2019

This is less cumbersome for consultants than standard semantic diagnostics, and allows for more detailed empirical description. We demonstrate this by investigating indexical shift in Uyghur. In addition to providing a more complete empirical picture, we suggest a modification to the analysis of Uyghur indexical shift proposed by Shklovsky and Sudo (2014).

One question that arose from this line of research is whether other attributes of Pokémon—specifically their types—show any tangible effects of sound symbolism. This question is related to the more general issue of what kinds of semantic attributes/dimensions can be signaled by sound symbolism. In answer to this question, Hosokawa et al. (2018) showed that the dark type characters are more likely to contain voiced stops and less likely to contain labial consonants in their names than the fairy type characters. The current judgment experiment shows that these associations are productive. Moreover, the effect sizes of sound symbolism were not correlated with each participant’s familiarity with Pokémon, suggesting that the sound symbolic knowledge is more abstract than what can be gleaned from the Pokémon lexicon.","['sound symbolism', 'labial consonants', 'voiced obstruents', 'pokémon', 'japanese', 'phonetics', 'phonology']",2019

In this short squib, I provide evidence that co-speech sound effects can generate the same inference pattern, in spite of the fact that co-speech sound effects lack many of the notable features of their gestural counterparts.

The analyses presented in the paper show that sound symbolic relationships can be modeled in the same way that we model phonological patterns. We suggest that there is nothing fundamental that prohibits formal phonologists from analyzing sound symbolic patterns, and that studying sound symbolism using a formal framework may open up a new, interesting research domain.

Teaching phonetics through sound symbolism,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004342/current.pdf?_s=Nr1fP-eDkUbcZLHJ,"['Kawahara, Shigeto']","Teaching introductory phonetics classes can be challenging for several reasons. One reason is that students are introduced with many new concepts such as place of articulation, manner of articulation, and the obstruent/sonorant distinction. Remembering these classification terms can be overwhelming and/or boring. Another challenge is that while many students taking phonetics classes are humanity major students who often do not like mathematics, understanding phonetics does require basic background in mathematics and physics. In this paper, I summarize my pedagogical attempt to lower the psychological boundary of students against learning these concepts by making use of sound symbolism in introductory phonetics class. Analyses of sound symbolic patterns can be presented using materials that students are familiar with (e.g. Disney characters and Pokémon monsters), so that the students feel that classification terms that phoneticians use are “real”. Furthermore, since some sound symbolic patterns are demonstrably grounded in the articulatory and acoustic natures of particular sounds, we are able to teach some important articulatory and acoustic principles. Finally, statistical analyses of the Pokémon dataset, which emerged from this teaching strategy, help us illustrate some important statistical skills.

Prosodic Systematicity Meets Language Development: Skewed Tonal Inventories in Non-Arbitrary Language,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003072/current.pdf?_s=3JCzcmOMkEWmTT2C,"['Thompson, Arthur']","Recent advances in the literature have focused on sketching phonosemantic mappings of imitative or iconic utterances by relying on vowels and consonants [1-5], leaving the suprasegmental information unexplored [6]. To begin bridging this gap, this study looks at the interaction of lexical tone and iconicity by comparing sound symbolic (i.e., mimetic, expressive, ideophonic) strata and general (i.e., arbitrary, prosaic, non-iconic) strata from three Chinese languages (Mandarin, Taiwanese Southern Min, Hong Kong Cantonese) using corpus-based means. For all three languages the distribution of tones in the sound symbolic strata are skewed so that the majority of syllables are largely confined to two tonal categories per language, one of which is high level, while the general strata exhibit no such tonal bias. These results indicate that phonological systematicity at the prosodic level might play an important role in demarcating an iconic class of words. This cross-linguistic tendency towards high tone mappings may be derived from phonotactic strategies to facilitate prosodic foregrounding of iconic utterances as well as an embodiment of expressive voice and marked pitch use like that of Infant Directed Speech.","['sound symbolism', 'tone', 'iconicity', 'chinese', 'mandarin', 'cantonese', 'southern min', 'phonology', 'ideophones']",2018
Post-Nasal Devoicing and a Probabilistic Model of Phonological Typology,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003232/current.pdf?_s=jgZFy1454U8gdYMn,"['Begus, Gasper']","This paper addresses one of the most contested issues in phonology: unnatural alternations. First, non-natural phonological processes are subdivided into unmotivated and unnatural. The central topic of the paper is an unnatural process: post-nasal devoicing. I collect thirteen cases of post-nasal devoicing and argue that in all reported cases, post-nasal devoicing does not derive from a single unnatural sound change (as claimed in some individual accounts of the data), but rather from a combination of three sound changes, each of which is phonetically motivated. I present new evidence showing that the three stages are directly historically attested in the pre-history of Yaghnobi. Based on several discussed cases, I propose a new diachronic model for explaining unnatural phenomena called the Blurring Process and point to its advantages over competing approaches (hypercorrection, perceptual enhancement, and phonetic motivation). The Blurring Process establishes general diachronic conditions for unnatural synchronic processes and can be employed to explain unnatural processes beyond post-nasal devoicing. Additionally, I provide a proof establishing the minimal sound changes required for an unmotivated/unnatural alternation to arise. The Blurring Process and Minimal Sound Change Requirement have implications for models of typology within the Channel Bias approach. This paper thus presents a first step towards the ultimate goal of quantifying the influences of Channel Bias on phonological typology.","['phonological typology', 'probabilistic modeling', 'bootstrapping', 'sound change', 'naturalness', 'channel bias', 'voice', 'post-nasal devoicing']",2018

The results show the following sound symbolic patterns to be productive: the participants tend to associate post-evolution characters with (1) names containing voiced obstruents ([b, d, g, z]), (2) names with more segments, (3) names containing [a], (4) names containing [u], and (5) names containing coronal consonants. Overall, the current results suggest that phonological properties of names non-trivially affect the naming patterns of new creatures, implying that the relationships between sounds and meanings are not as arbitrary as modern linguistic theories generally assume.","['sound symbolism', 'english', 'voicing', 'iconicity of quantity', 'pokemonastics!', 'phonology']",2018

of contact. Specifically, affricate-dense areas depend on the emergence of retroflex affricates.

A Formal Model of Phonological Typology,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003574/current.pdf?_s=c7QOyDmAzdrIutEA,"['Begus, Gasper']","Identifying and modeling factors that influence typology has been one of the most contested issues in phonology with two major lines of thought emerging in this discussion: the Analytic Bias (AB) and Channel Bias (CB) approach (Moreton 2008). Empirical evidence in favor of both approaches exists, yet very few attempts have been made to model them together. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a new MaxEnt-compatible model of phonological typology that models both AB and CB together. The first step towards a new model of typology is to establish quantitative models of each of the subcomponents: AB and CB. To encode the AB portion of the typology, we adopt Wilson’s (2006) approach of differentiating variance in the prior of a MaxEnt model of phonological learning; to encode the CB portion, we adopt Beguš’s (2016) new model of typology within CB that operates with Historical Probabilities of Alternations and an estimation method called Bootstrapping Sound Changes. This paper proposes a new model of typology that combines differentiating prior variance (AB; Wilson 2006) with estimating Historical Weights based on Historical Probabilities (CB; Beguš 2016), whereby both variables influence the typology. I further argue that this new model performs better than the current “split” models on the basis of two alternations, post-nasal voicing and devoicing, and point to future directions this line of research should take.

As a case study, a previous corpus-based research identified some specific sound symbolic relationships in Pokemon naming patterns in Japanese [1]. One of the main findings was that the names of Pokemon characters are more likely to contain voiced obstruents and are longer in terms of mora counts, when they undergo evolution (e.g. /nyoromo/ => /nyorobon/; /poppo/ => /pijotto/.). The current study reports three experiments that test whether (i) these patterns are productive in the minds of general Japanese speakers (Experiments 1 and 2), and whether (ii) the same tendency would hold with English speakers (Experiment 3). The results show that the effect of mora length was clearly observed both with Japanese speakers and English speakers; the effects of voiced obstruents were observed clearly with Japanese speakers, and less clearly with English speakers. Further analyses show that familiarity with Pokemon may influence their responses, suggesting the possibility that speakers can learn sound-symbolic patterns from a particular set of lexical items (i.e. “the Pokemon lexicon”). Besides its research value, we argue that this general project can be useful for undergraduate phonetics education.
