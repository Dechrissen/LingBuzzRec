Exploring the nature of cumulativity through sound symbolism: Experimental studies of Pokémonastics with English speakers,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005243/current.pdf?_s=xJ3X-Anel3JbABdc,"['Kawahara, Shigeto', 'Breiss, Canaan']","There has been a dramatic rise of interest in sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. Despite this, one aspect that is still markedly under-explored is its cumulative nature, i.e., when there are two or more sounds with the same symbolic meaning, whether these effects add up or not. These questions are important to address, since they bear on the general question of how speakers take into account multiple sources of evidence when they make linguistic decisions. Inspired by an accumulating body of research on cumulativity in other linguistic patterns, two experiments on sound symbolism using Pokémon names were conducted with native speakers of English. The experiments tested two types of cumulativity: counting cumulativity, which holds if the effects of multiple instances of the same factor add up, and ganging-up cumulativity, which holds when the effects of different factors add up. The experiments addressed whether these patterns of cumulativity hold in sound symbolism, and, more importantly, if so, how. We found that (1) three factors can show ganging-up cumulativity, (2) counting cumulativity and ganging-up cumulativity can coexist in a single system (3) ganging-up cumulativity patterns can plausibly be considered to be linear, and (4) counting cumulativity effects can be sub-linear.","['cumulativity', 'sound symbolism', 'pokémonastics', 'voicing', 'the iconicity of quantity', 'phonology']",2020
A wug-shaped curve in sound symbolism: The case of Japanese Pokémon names,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005382/current.pdf?_s=IgNWU6w6KGxbq-bu,"['Kawahara, Shigeto']","Whether linguistic patterns show cumulative effects or not is an issue that is currently debated in contemporary phonological studies. This paper attempts to shed new light on this debate from a novel perspective by studying sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. The current experiment shows that when Japanese speakers judge Pokémons’ evolution status based on nonce names, the judgments are affected both by their mora count and the presence of a voiced obstruent. The effects of mora count instantiate a case of counting cumulativity, while the interaction between these two factors instantiates ganging-up cumulativity. These two cumulative patterns observed in the current experiment together result in what Hayes (2020) refers to as “wug-shaped curves,” a quantitative signature predicted by MaxEnt. The paper shows that the experimental results can indeed be successfully modeled using MaxEnt, equipped with the sort of phonological constraints that have been used in the Optimality Theoretic research. I also examine Stochastic Optimality Theory in light of the current experimental results and show that this theory faces an interesting set of challenges. Finally, in this paper I make a novel methodological proposal for general phonological inquiry and sound symbolism research. The current study was inspired by Hayes (2020), a proposal made within formal phonology. The experiment ended up revealing important, hitherto understudied aspects of sound symbolism, and in turn, it revealed how cumulativity manifests itself in linguistic patterns. The current exploration thus shows by way of a case study that formal phonology and research on sound symbolism can mutually inform one another.

Bootstrapping Sound Changes,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004299/current.pdf?_s=vfei2xS-o_We5M5X,"['Begus, Gasper']","This paper presents a technique for estimating the influences of channel bias on phonological typology. The technique based on statistical bootstrapping enables the estimation of Historical Probability, the probability that a synchronic alternation arises based on two diachronic factors -- the number of sound changes required for an alternation to arise and their respective probabilities. We estimate Historical Probabilities of six attested and unattested alternations targeting feature [voice], compare Historical Probabilities of these alternations, perform inferential statistics on the comparison, and compare outputs of the diachronic model against the independently observed synchronic typology to evaluate the performance of the channel bia approach. The proposed technique also identies mismatches in typological predictions of the analytic bias and channel bias approaches. By comparing these mismatches with the observed typology, this paper attempts to quantitatively evaluate the distinct contributions of the two influences on typology in a set of alternations targeting feature [voice].","['historical phonology', 'sound change', 'bootstrapping', 'learnability', 'typology', 'phonology']",2020
On Sound-Meaning Correlation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005472/current.pdf?_s=5IF07JGodlW1GpFb,"['Mukherji, Nirmalangshu']","The intriguing fact about human language is that neither the sound systems nor the thought systems--technically called Sensorimotor and Conceptual-intentional systems--have any significant precedence prior to the emergence of the hominid line. So, a theory of language needs to explain where they came from and how they fell into place to create the conditions for unbounded generativity. In effect, language-theory needs to explain two novel factors in the evolution of human language: word-formation and word-combination. In this context, the recent proposal that the sound component of language is 'ancillary', and that language is basically designed for thought, is problematic. This is because the proposal turns the origin of the rich structure of human thought into a mystery since the units of human thought could not have been borrowed from, say, the apes. To look for an alternative explanation, we study Darwin's idea that (a) the sound system might have evolved in part from a pre-existing human music system, (b) the evolving sound systems might have 'acted on' rudimentary units of thought systems to turn them into words. We critically evaluate Darwin's picture. In the process, we locate the gaps in Darwin's story that must be filled to reach a more complete theory of language.","['language evolution', 'sound system', 'sound ancillary hypothesis', 'thought system', 'generativity', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Artificial sound change: Language change and deep convolutional neural networks in iterative learning,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005558/current.pdf?_s=er8UBO5KaqRfqttm,"['Begus, Gasper']","This paper proposes a framework for modeling sound change that combines deep
convolutional neural networks and iterative learning. Acquisition and transmission of
speech across generations is modeled by training generations of Generative
Adversarial Networks on unannotated raw speech data. The paper argues that several
properties of sound change emerge from the proposed architecture. Generative
Adversarial Networks (Goodfellow et al. 2014, Donahue et al. 2019) are uniquely
appropriate for modeling language change because the networks are trained on raw
unsupervised acoustic data, contain no language-specific devices and, as argued in
Beguš (2020b), encode phonetic and phonological representations in their latent space
and generate innovative data that are linguistically highly informative. Four generations
of Generative Adversarial Networks were trained on an allophonic distribution in
English where voiceless stops are aspirated word-initially before stressed vowels except if preceded by [s]. The first generation of networks is trained on the relevant sequences in human speech from the TIMIT database. The subsequent generations are not trained on TIMIT, but on generated outputs from the previous generation and thus start learning from each other in an iterative learning task. The initial allophonic distribution is progressively being lost with each generation, likely due to pressures. from the global distribution of aspiration in the training data that resembles phonological pressures in natural language. The networks show signs of a gradual shift in phonetic targets characteristic of a gradual phonetic sound change. At endpoints, the networks' outputs superficially resemble a phonological change --- rule loss --- driven by imperfect learning. The model features signs of stability, one of the more challenging aspects of computational models of sound change. The results suggest that the proposed Generative Adversarial models of phonetic and phonological acquisition have the potential to yield new insights into the long-standing question of how to model language change.","['artificial intelligence', 'deep convolutional neural networks', 'generative adversarial networks', 'speech', 'phonetic learning', 'phonological learning', 'historical linguistics', 'sound change', 'phonology']",2020
Sound-symbolic effects of voiced obstruents and mora counts on monster names  in Digital Monster and Monster Hunter and on the spell names in Final Fantasy,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005402/current.pdf?_s=k18AHxs8i5oDFkdz,"['Kumagai, Gakuji', 'Yoshitake, Kazuaki', 'Tanji, Hiromu', 'Matsuhashi, Takuya']","The current paper shows three case studies of sound symbolism in fictional names featured in popular Japanese computer games: Digital Monster, Monster Hunter, and Final Fantasy. First, we show positive correlations between evolutionary stages and the number of voiced obstruents and the number of morae in Digital Monster.

Second, we show that only the effect of the morae is positively associated with the size (height) of the monsters in Monster Hunter.

A stripy wug-shaped curves in sound symbolism,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005476/current.pdf?_s=PY942zo2aH3EA1ks,"['Kawahara, Shigeto']","In recent years, Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar (MaxEnt HG) has been successfully applied to model various linguistic patterns. Building on these studies, the current experiment examines its quantitative signatures, typical probabilistic patterns that this framework is predicted to generate Hayes (2020). Given a linear scale of violations of one constraint, MaxEnt yields a sigmoid curve. When another constraint is relevant, this sigmoid curve can be shifted, yielding two sigmoid curves, which together look like a wug, our beloved animal in the linguistics community. When the second constraint can be violated more than once, MaxEnt predicts that it yields a set of multiple sigmoid curves separated from one another, resulting in a ""stripy wug-shaped curve."" The current experiment demonstrates that we observe a stripy wug-shaped curve in patterns of sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. Concretely, the experiment shows that the judgment of Pokémons' evolution status is cumulatively affected by the mora counts of nonce names, resulting in a sigmoid curve, and that this sigmoid curve can be shifted according to the number of voiced obstruents contained in the names. This paper concludes that MaxEnt HG is a useful framework to model sound-meaning mappings, and suggests that there may be a meaningful parallel between sound symbolic patterns and probabilistic phonological patterns.

Reduplication: A New Distributed Morphology Approach,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005292/current.pdf?_s=wywLLu2Y1GGyzPs6,"['Alqarni, Muteb']","The current paper aims to capture the properties of reduplication within the distributed morphology model (Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994; Embick and Noyer 2006; Siddiqi 2009; Embick 2010). Taking Standard Arabic (SA) as a representative, the article shows that SA, like many other languages, has both full and partial reduplication. Full reduplication repeats entire words or stems whereas partial reduplication doubles part of the stem. Rather than the available two analyses, i.e. the readjustment approach (Raimy 2000; Frampton 2009) and the affixation approach (Haugen 2008; Haugen and Harley 2010; Haugen 2011), the current paper provides a novel approach to the phenomenon of reduplication in the world languages. It argues that root consonants and vowels should be decomposed into non-phonetic distinctive features that undergo late insertion at PF. These non-phonetic distinctive features are supplied with sound items at PF in the same fashion that the terminal nodes with morphosyntactic features are fed with vocabulary items. This approach serves three purposes. It accounts for speech errors, captures the non-concatenative morphology in Semitic languages, and allows the reduplicant form to copy all the distinctive features of the roots, yielding instances of full reduplication. Instances of partial reduplication can be generated by root-sensitive impoverishment rules which target and delete some of the features of the stem or the reduplicant form.","['reduplication', 'standard arabic', 'distributed morphology', 'sound items', 'impoverishment rule', 'morphology']",2020
Do sibilants fly?

From modern perspectives, these statements can be understood as an assertion about sound symbolism, systematic connections between sounds and meanings. Inspired by these writers, this paper reports on an experiment which tests a sound symbolic value of sibilants. The experiment is a case study situated within the Pokémonastics research paradigm, in which researchers explore the sound symbolic patterns in natural languages using Pokémon names. The current experiment shows that when presented with pairs of a flying type Pokémon character and a normal type Pokémon character, Japanese speakers are more likely to associate the flying type Pokémons with names that contain sibilants than those names that do not contain sibilants. As was pointed out by Socrates, the sound symbolic connection identified in the experiment is likely to be grounded in the articulatory properties of sibilants---the large amount of oral airflow that accompanies the production of sibilants. Various implications of the current experiment for the sound symbolism research are discussed throughout the paper.","['phonetics', 'phonology', 'sound symbolism', 'pokémon', 'sibilants', 'type', 'flying', 'socrates', 'the upanishads', 'phonology']",2020
Playful speculations on how language might be and why there is functional material,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005085/current.pdf?_s=oYRaWpIx4kQT9zN6,"['Arsenijevic, Boban']","Hierarchical constituent structures are a hallmark property of natural language. Traditional generative syntax either generates these structures solely in the module of syntax, as in main-stream generativism (Chomsky 1995), or different modules generate them in parallel (Kaplan and. Bresnan 1982, Jackendoff 1983). I argue that the source of hierarchical structure in language is a specific algorithm of knowledge retrieval and update. The procedure of information retrieval and update is domain-general, as it builds, maintains and retrieves general-purpose web-shaped knowledge representations. The way of operation of this component is such that its output consists in the type of hierarchical structures observed among linguistic constituents. These structures, representing segments from the knowledge representation, are mapped to and recovered from the phonological structure by a language specific mapping component. This view dispenses with the module of syntax, reducing the space between phonology and semantics to an algorithm mapping between hierarchical and linear structures. Illustrations are provided of the proposed structure of knowledge representation, of the mechanisms and outputs of the procedure of information retrieval and update, and of main operations involved in the mapping algorithm. It is shown how at a certain stage in the mapping, exactly structures attributed to linguistic expressions in generative grammar, in particular those argued for in Kayne (1994) and in cartographic approaches to syntax (Rizzi 1997, Cinque 1999, Cinque and Rizzi 2008), emerge, thus indicating that the proposed modification of the big picture does not significantly affect the empirical research into the meaning - constituency - word order interactions, or models provided to account for them. It is argued that the material in grammar identified as functional corresponds to those elements of knowledge representation which have priority in retrieval and a special role in the mapping algorithm, due to their universality and/or high frequency of occurrence. A discussion is provided of how this shift affects the architecture of grammar, as well as of some of the other general questions opened by the proposal.","['hierarchical structure', 'language architecture', 'sound-meaning mapping', 'semantics', 'syntax', 'functional material']",2020

This paper reviews major studies on sound symbolism and argues that sound symbolism can be an interesting topic of exploration for theoretical phonologists. This paper also demonstrates that insights gained by phonological research can shed light on some important issues in the studies of sound symbolism, and vice versa. Overall, I hope that this paper is informative for both theoretical phonologists and researchers who work on sound symbolism.","['sound symbolism', 'the phonetics-phonology interface', 'articulation', 'acoustics', 'cumulativity', 'language acquisition', 'the origin and evolution of languages', 'phonology']",2020
What voiced obstruents symbolically represent in Japanese: Evidence from the Pokémon universe,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005125/current.pdf?_s=UGsKRcJSZrpnTAWL,"['Kawahara, Shigeto', 'Kumagai, Gakuji']","Kawahara et al. (2018b) found that within the corpus of existing Pokémon names, the number of voiced obstruents in the characters’ names correlates positively with their weight, height, evolution levels and attack values. While later experimental studies to some extent confirmed the productivity of these sound symbolic relationships (e.g. Kawahara & Kumagai 2019a), they are limited, due to the fact that the visual images presented to the participants primarily differed with regard to evolution levels. The current experiment thus for the first time directly explored how each of these semantic dimensions---weight, height, evolution levels, and attack values---correlate with the number of voiced obstruents in nonce names. The results of two judgment experiments show that all of these parameters indeed correlate positively with the number of voiced obstruents in the names. Overall, the results show that a particular class of sounds---in our case a set of voiced obstruents---can signal different semantic meanings within a single language, supporting the pluripotentiality of sound symbolism (Winter et al., 2019). We also address another general issue that has been under-explored in the literature on sound symbolism; namely, its cumulative nature. In both of the experiments, we observe that two voiced obstruents evoke stronger images than one voiced obstruent, instantiating what is known as the counting cumulativity effect (Jäger & Rosenbach, 2006).","['sound symbolism', 'japanese', 'pokémon', 'cumulativity', 'pluripotentiality', 'phonetics', 'phonology']",2020
English speakers can infer Pokémon types using sound symbolism,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005129/current.pdf?_s=28s0hUcHyCS37bwv,"['Kawahara, Shigeto', 'Kumagai, Gakuji', 'Godoy, Mahayana']","Sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings, is receiving increasing attention in linguistics and related disciplines. One general question that is currently explored is what sorts of semantic properties can be symbolically represented. Against this background, within the general research paradigm which explores the nature of sound symbolism using Pokémon names, several recent studies have shown that Japanese speakers associate certain classes of sounds with notions that are as complex as Pokémon types. Specifically, they associate (1) sibilants with the flying type, (2) voiced obstruents with the dark type, and (3) labials with the fairy type. These sound symbolic effects arguably have their roots in the phonetic properties of the sounds at issue, and are hence not expected to be specific to Japanese. The current study thus tested these sound symbolic associations with English speakers. Two experiments show that they can reliably make these three sound symbolic connections, similar to Japanese speakers. These results support the hypothesis advanced by Shih et al.

We present two experiments investigating sentences with co-speech sound effects and co-text emoji in lieu of gestures, revealing a remarkably similar projection pattern to that of co-speech gestures. The results suggest that gestural inferences do not project because of any traits specific to gestures, but rather because of their status as ""co-linguistic content"".","['co-linguistic content', 'gesture', 'emoji', 'sound effects', 'semantics']",2020

Specifically, we build on a series of studies conducted within a research paradigm called ""Pokémonastics,"" which uses the Pokémon universe to explore sound symbolic patterns in natural languages. Inspired by a study of existing English Pokémon names (Shih et al. 2018), two experiments were conducted in which native speakers of English were provided with pairs of pre-evolution and post-evolution Pokémon characters, the latter of which were always larger. The participants were given two name choices whose members were systematically different in some phonological properties. The results show the following sound symbolic patterns to be productive: (1) names with higher segment counts are more likely to be associated with post-evolution characters than names with lower segment counts, (2) names containing [a] are more likely to be associated with post-evolution characters than names containing [i], (3) names containing [u] are more likely to be associated with post-evolution characters than names containing [i], and (4) names containing coronals are more likely to be associated with post-evolution characters than names containing labials. Overall, the current results suggest that phonological considerations come into play when English speakers name new creatures.

Sound symbolic patterns in Pokémon move names,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003742/current.pdf?_s=naUTHBoMqJ_I6fN-,"['Kawahara, Shigeto']","In recent years, we have witnessed a dramatically growing interest in sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. A recent case study of sound symbolism shows that in Pokémon games, longer names are generally associated with stronger Pokémon characters, and moreover those Pokémon characters with names having more voiced obstruents are generally stronger (Kawahara et al., 2018b). The current study examined the productivity of these sound symbolic effects in the names of the moves that Pokémon creatures use when they battle. The analysis of the existing move names shows that the effect of name length on attack values is robust, and that the effect of voiced obstruents is tangible. These sound symbolic patterns hold, despite the fact that most (= 99%) move names are based on real words in Japanese. An additional experiment with nonce names shows that both of these effects are very robust. Overall, the current paper adds to the growing body of studies showing that the relationships between sounds and meanings are not as arbitrary as modern linguistic theories have standardly assumed. Uniquely, the current analysis of the existing move names shows that such non-arbitrary relationships can hold even when the set of words under consideration are mostly existing words (Shih & Rudin, 2019; Sidhu et al., 2019).

By pointing out a non-trivial parallel between sound symbolic connections and phonological mappings, I hope to show theoretical phonologists that studying sound symbolism can be interesting and informative. I also hope to show those researchers who study sound symbolism that an analytical device that theoretical linguists employ is useful in that it allows us to model an important aspect of sound symbolism. My ultimate goal is thus to enhance the communication between theoretical phonologists and researchers who work on sound symbolism who are not yet interested in theoretical phonology. The paper also has a descriptive value in that it summarizes various cases of cumulative effects in sound symbolic patterns from a variety of languages.

Interaction forces, derived from a simple model of the language learning process, are attractive at short range and repulsive at long range. This generates sets of acoustic clusters, each representing a distinct sound, which form patterns with similar statistical properties to real vowel systems. Our formulation may be generalised to account for spontaneous self actuating shifts in system structure which are observed in real languages, and to combine in one model two previously distinct theories of vowel system structure: dispersion theory, which assumes that vowel systems maximize contrasts between sounds, and quantal theory, according to which non linear relationships between articulatory and acoustic parameters are the source of patterns in sound inventories. By formulating the dynamics of vowel sounds using inter-particle forces, we also provide a simple unified description of the linguistic notion of push and pull dynamics in vowel systems.","['dispersion theory', 'vowel systems', 'quantal theory', 'typology', 'chain shifts', 'phonology']",2019

human language. However, precisely because language is a complex system, tied to perception,
learning, memory, and social organization, the assumption of modularity can
also be an obstacle to understanding language at a deeper level.

two aspects of modeling work that receive relatively little attention: the formal mapping
from model to theory, and the scalability of demonstration models. A series of
implemented models of sound change are analyzed in this way. As theoretical inconsistencies
are discovered, possible solutions are proposed, incrementally constructing a
set of sufficient properties for a working model. Because internal theoretical consistency
is enforced, this model corresponds to an explanatorily adequate theory. And because
explicit links between modules are required, this is a theory, not only of sound change,

"How cute do I sound?: The iconic function of segmental alternation in Korean baby-talk register, Aegyo",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004857/current.pdf?_s=GDYfzzZon9TkzVra,"['Jang, Hayeun']","This paper presents the corpus and experimental studies of segmental alternation as strategies of the baby- talk register in Korean, Aegyo. Using a frequency analysis on Twitter and a cuteness-rating experiment, we address questions about the relationship between types of segmental alternation used in the Aegyo register and the iconic strength of Aegyo expressions. We find that the preference for Aegyo expressions and the degree of cuteness of Aegyo forms are determined by how natural the sound sequence resulting from the alternations was in Korean phonological structure. This suggests an interaction between the pure phonological constraints and the register-specific constraints in core grammar. We also find evidence that gender and age can be at play as a scaling factor of the register-specific constraints: older speakers and female speakers are more sensitive than are younger and male speakers to levels of cuteness in Aegyo expressions, depending on the segmental alternation used in the expressions. This is because the function of Aegyo register is to set up a special childlike persona of addressers in intimate relationship by rejecting mature language and intentionally speaking like a child.","['baby-talk speech register', 'iconic strength', 'segmental alternation', 'gender and age effects', 'phonology']",2019

We investigated phonological correlations between baseball player statistics and their given first names, chosen baseball-official first names, and baseball nicknames. We found numerous sound symbolic associations in player-chosen names and nicknames, where conscious design plays a role in choosing a name that may communicate an attribute. These associations were often mediated by language-specific hypocoristic formation processes.

This question is related to the more general issue of what kinds of semantic attributes/dimensions can be signaled by sound symbolism. In answer to this question, Hosokawa et al. (2018) showed that the dark type characters are more likely to contain voiced stops and less likely to contain labial consonants in their names than the fairy type characters.

The analyses presented in the paper show that sound symbolic relationships can be modeled in the same way that we model phonological patterns. We suggest that there is nothing fundamental that prohibits formal phonologists from analyzing sound symbolic patterns, and that studying sound symbolism using a formal framework may open up a new, interesting research domain.

Another challenge is that while many students taking phonetics classes are humanity major students who often do not like mathematics, understanding phonetics does require basic background in mathematics and physics. In this paper, I summarize my pedagogical attempt to lower the psychological boundary of students against learning these concepts by making use of sound symbolism in introductory phonetics class. Analyses of sound symbolic patterns can be presented using materials that students are familiar with (e.g. Disney characters and Pokémon monsters), so that the students feel that classification terms that phoneticians use are “real”. Furthermore, since some sound symbolic patterns are demonstrably grounded in the articulatory and acoustic natures of particular sounds, we are able to teach some important articulatory and acoustic principles. Finally, statistical analyses of the Pokémon dataset, which emerged from this teaching strategy, help us illustrate some important statistical skills.

Prosodic Systematicity Meets Language Development: Skewed Tonal Inventories in Non-Arbitrary Language,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003072/current.pdf?_s=TN8HSzsX-TKqVtHY,"['Thompson, Arthur']","Recent advances in the literature have focused on sketching phonosemantic mappings of imitative or iconic utterances by relying on vowels and consonants [1-5], leaving the suprasegmental information unexplored [6]. To begin bridging this gap, this study looks at the interaction of lexical tone and iconicity by comparing sound symbolic (i.e., mimetic, expressive, ideophonic) strata and general (i.e., arbitrary, prosaic, non-iconic) strata from three Chinese languages (Mandarin, Taiwanese Southern Min, Hong Kong Cantonese) using corpus-based means. For all three languages the distribution of tones in the sound symbolic strata are skewed so that the majority of syllables are largely confined to two tonal categories per language, one of which is high level, while the general strata exhibit no such tonal bias. These results indicate that phonological systematicity at the prosodic level might play an important role in demarcating an iconic class of words. This cross-linguistic tendency towards high tone mappings may be derived from phonotactic strategies to facilitate prosodic foregrounding of iconic utterances as well as an embodiment of expressive voice and marked pitch use like that of Infant Directed Speech.","['sound symbolism', 'tone', 'iconicity', 'chinese', 'mandarin', 'cantonese', 'southern min', 'phonology', 'ideophones']",2018

First, non-natural phonological processes are subdivided into unmotivated and unnatural. The central topic of the paper is an unnatural process: post-nasal devoicing. I collect thirteen cases of post-nasal devoicing and argue that in all reported cases, post-nasal devoicing does not derive from a single unnatural sound change (as claimed in some individual accounts of the data), but rather from a combination of three sound changes, each of which is phonetically motivated. I present new evidence showing that the three stages are directly historically attested in the pre-history of Yaghnobi. Based on several discussed cases, I propose a new diachronic model for explaining unnatural phenomena called the Blurring Process and point to its advantages over competing approaches (hypercorrection, perceptual enhancement, and phonetic motivation). The Blurring Process establishes general diachronic conditions for unnatural synchronic processes and can be employed to explain unnatural processes beyond post-nasal devoicing. Additionally, I provide a proof establishing the minimal sound changes required for an unmotivated/unnatural alternation to arise. The Blurring Process and Minimal Sound Change Requirement have implications for models of typology within the Channel Bias approach. This paper thus presents a first step towards the ultimate goal of quantifying the influences of Channel Bias on phonological typology.","['phonological typology', 'probabilistic modeling', 'bootstrapping', 'sound change', 'naturalness', 'channel bias', 'voice', 'post-nasal devoicing']",2018

Empirical evidence in favor of both approaches exists, yet very few attempts have been made to model them together. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a new MaxEnt-compatible model of phonological typology that models both AB and CB together. The first step towards a new model of typology is to establish quantitative models of each of the subcomponents: AB and CB. To encode the AB portion of the typology, we adopt Wilson’s (2006) approach of differentiating variance in the prior of a MaxEnt model of phonological learning; to encode the CB portion, we adopt Beguš’s (2016) new model of typology within CB that operates with Historical Probabilities of Alternations and an estimation method called Bootstrapping Sound Changes. This paper proposes a new model of typology that combines differentiating prior variance (AB; Wilson 2006) with estimating Historical Weights based on Historical Probabilities (CB; Beguš 2016), whereby both variables influence the typology. I further argue that this new model performs better than the current “split” models on the basis of two alternations, post-nasal voicing and devoicing, and point to future directions this line of research should take.

As a case study, a previous corpus-based research identified some specific sound symbolic relationships in Pokemon naming patterns in Japanese [1]. One of the main findings was that the names of Pokemon characters are more likely to contain voiced obstruents and are longer in terms of mora counts, when they undergo evolution (e.g. /nyoromo/ => /nyorobon/; /poppo/ => /pijotto/.). The current study reports three experiments that test whether (i) these patterns are productive in the minds of general Japanese speakers (Experiments 1 and 2), and whether (ii) the same tendency would hold with English speakers (Experiment 3). The results show that the effect of mora length was clearly observed both with Japanese speakers and English speakers; the effects of voiced obstruents were observed clearly with Japanese speakers, and less clearly with English speakers. Further analyses show that familiarity with Pokemon may influence their responses, suggesting the possibility that speakers can learn sound-symbolic patterns from a particular set of lexical items (i.e. “the Pokemon lexicon”). Besides its research value, we argue that this general project can be useful for undergraduate phonetics education.

In her 2014 book, Virginia Hill analyzes vocatives as forms of address; they are converted to syntax as nominal functional projections in the form of vocative phrases. Drawing on work by Speas and Tenny (2003) and Moro (2003), she further posits that vocatives merge as arguments of a speech act phrase in the left periphery. This merging site, Hill 2014 and others (e.g., Slocum 2016) argue, is fixed. This is so despite the fact that vocatives may appear in different positions in their host clause. Under this account, pre-vocative elements appear in that location as a result of movement. This paper presents counterevidence to this argument from Arabic. Using naturally occurring data, mainly from Twitter, the paper shows that Arabic vocatives do not merge in a fixed position in the left periphery. Rather, they are parenthetical adjuncts whose relationship with their host clause is minimally constrained.

The Mirror Alignment Principle: Morpheme Ordering at the Morphosyntax-Phonology Interface,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005374/current.pdf?_s=oly-g_tvt4XBroV1,"['Zukoff, Sam']","As codified by Baker’s (1985) “Mirror Principle”, the linear order of morphemes within a word generally correlates with hierarchical syntactic structure. While Baker uses morphological ordering to demonstrate the inseparability of syntax and morphology, he does not dwell on the formal means by Mirror Principle-compliance is enacted in the grammar, tacitly assuming a cyclic morphological concatenation-based system.

This paper develops a new framework for morpheme ordering, the Mirror Alignment Principle (MAP), which derives the Mirror Principle while avoiding some of the
shortcomings of cyclic morphological concatenation. The MAP is a morphology/phonology-interface algorithm that takes morphosyntactic c-command relations and
dynamically translates them into a ranking of Alignment constraints (McCarthy and Prince 1993) in CON in the phonological component. All possible morpheme orders are generated by GEN, and the optimal surface order is selected by EVAL. Even though morpheme order is computed in the phonology, the driving force behind this order is the syntax/morphology. This link between grammatical components generates Mirror Principle-compliant morpheme orders.

This paper focuses on two case studies. First, it will show how the MAP is consistent with the complex interaction between Mirror Principle-satisfaction and the
“CARP template” in Bantu (Hyman 2003). Second, it will show that the MAP can explain ordering alternations within Arabic’s nonconcatenative verbal system. This
will demonstrate that Mirror Principle-behavior can indeed be identified even in nonconcatenative morphology. Lastly, the paper situates the MAP proposal within the broader debates surrounding the phonology-morphology interface, with special attention to infixation.","['mirror principle', 'alignment', 'morpheme ordering', 'bantu carp template', 'arabic nonconcatenative morphology', 'infixation', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2020
Reduplication: A New Distributed Morphology Approach,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005292/current.pdf?_s=0sgxJYRsET-FS8-u,"['Alqarni, Muteb']","The current paper aims to capture the properties of reduplication within the distributed morphology model (Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994; Embick and Noyer 2006; Siddiqi 2009; Embick 2010). Taking Standard Arabic (SA) as a representative, the article shows that SA, like many other languages, has both full and partial reduplication. Full reduplication repeats entire words or stems whereas partial reduplication doubles part of the stem. Rather than the available two analyses, i.e. the readjustment approach (Raimy 2000; Frampton 2009) and the affixation approach (Haugen 2008; Haugen and Harley 2010; Haugen 2011), the current paper provides a novel approach to the phenomenon of reduplication in the world languages. It argues that root consonants and vowels should be decomposed into non-phonetic distinctive features that undergo late insertion at PF. These non-phonetic distinctive features are supplied with sound items at PF in the same fashion that the terminal nodes with morphosyntactic features are fed with vocabulary items. This approach serves three purposes. It accounts for speech errors, captures the non-concatenative morphology in Semitic languages, and allows the reduplicant form to copy all the distinctive features of the roots, yielding instances of full reduplication. Instances of partial reduplication can be generated by root-sensitive impoverishment rules which target and delete some of the features of the stem or the reduplicant form.","['reduplication', 'standard arabic', 'distributed morphology', 'sound items', 'impoverishment rule', 'morphology']",2020

Exclamatives are nonsententials: Evidence from Arabic and other languages,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005031/current.pdf?_s=2005sSMuwQQD3IE2,"['Al-Bataineh, Hussein']","Previous studies overlook the fact that exclamatives (Excls) are temporally deictic to the here and now, and they are anchored by the context rather than Tense (i.e., they lack the TP layer), and that they are constructed crosslinguistically as nonclausal projections. This paper provides an overview of the literature and highlights that the clausal type of Excls is not agreed upon, the defining features (e.g., factivity, scalar implicature, and question/answer relations) are highly controversial and cross-linguistically invalid, and previous analyses seem inconsistent, complicated, and inadequate to account for the idiosyncrasies of Excls. Unlike previous studies, the paper claims that Excls as asymmetrical small clauses selected by Excl head. This analysis accounts for the peculiarities and intricacies of the three types of Arabic Excls (i.e., Wh-Excls, vocative Excls, and verbal Excls) such as (i) their inflexible word order, (ii) case alternation on the referent, (iii) the presence of spurious prepositions, and (vi) the obligatory presence of some particles and affixes although not semantically required. Since the given peculiarities are not specific to Arabic and are found in other languages and supported by cross-linguistic data, the paper claims that the nonsentential approach is empirically more defensible and conceptually simpler to account for Excls crosslinguistically.","['exclamation', 'syntactic haplology', 'morphological templates', 'case assignment', 'word order', 'factivity', 'scalar implicature', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Gender and Number in Tunisian Arabic: A case of contextual allosemy,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005266/current.pdf?_s=XI3sM-eLhxpYY7zI,"['Dali, Myriam']","In this thesis, I investigate the distribution and function(s) of gender in Tunisian
Arabic. Based on the observation that gender can ll multiple functions and hence
receive different interpretations in TA, I consider gender in this language to be subject
to contextual allosemy. Allosemy is the equivalent of conditioned allomorphy at the
level of LF (Wood, 2012; Marantz, 2013;Wood and Marantz, 2017) and is dened as a
phenomenon in which a single morpheme can have multiple semantic realizations. My
proposal is based on the observation that the interpretation of gender is conditioned
by its syntactic environment, more specifically, by the class of the base noun and the
function and interpretation of any node or abstract morpheme (e.g., number) that
is parasitic of the n head hosting the class feature.
The current predominant view of gender in syntactic theory is that it has a
nominalizing function (Lecarme, 2002; Kihm, 2005; Lowenstamm, 2008; Acquaviva,
2009; Kramer, 2009, 2014, 2015; Hammerly, 2018). According to this view, gender
is hosted on the n head, which selects the root, and assigns it a nominal category
(assuming DM). However, Arabic has other uses for the feminine gender, most of
them associated with number. This, I argue, originates from the diachronic trajectory
of the feminine affix -a in Proto-Semitic, where it started out as a nominalizer,
then a singulative affix, then a group marker, before finally marking feminine gender
(Hasselbach, 2014a,b; Dali and Mathieu, 2019a). These subsequent layers of meanings
associated with what is now known as gender are all present in the synchronic
picture of Arabic. Through an exhaustive inventory of data and diagnostics, I show
that the role of gender is pervasive within the Tunisian Arabic DP, and is not limited
to nominalization. To account for these facts, I propose that gender is distributed
among the different functional heads of the DP: Num, Q, D (see also Farkas 1990;
Ritter 1993; Giurgea 2008; Croitor and Giurgea 2009; Steriopolo and Wiltschko 2010;
Fassi Fehri 2012, 2018b,a; Dali and Mathieu 2019a).
The present thesis also focuses on plurals. I show that plural markers can also
be distributed along the nominal spine (Acquaviva, 2008; Harbour, 2008; Wiltschko,
2008, 2012; Butler, 2012; Mathieu, 2012, 2013, 2014; Kramer, 2016), accounting for
their different functions (e.g., classifying, grouping, counting). These different functions
associated with Arabic plurals are, I argue, due to the existence of a singulative
operator that is not limited to the collective system, but is pervasive in Tunisian Arabic,
as I show. Finally, these observations all suggest that one and the same abstract
morpheme (e.g., the feminine and the plural) can receive different interpretations
depending on the base they attach to and on their syntactic level, which motivates
the allosemic analysis put forward in this thesis.","['arabic', 'gender', 'allosemy', 'number', 'plural', 'singulative', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
The syntax of the addressee in imperatives: What Levantine Arabic attitude datives bring to the table,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005086/current.pdf?_s=mDzJmJ_oKpNpEPu_,"['Haddad, Youssef']","The imperative subject constitutes a special category compared to the subjects of other types of clauses in that it is required to be the addressee. Zanuttini (2008) argues that this requirement follows from a special syntactic status: imperative subjects enter the computation with gender and number but no person features. They acquire a second-person specification later by entering an agreement relation with the head of a jussive phrase, a functional projection that is unique for imperative clauses and that occupies the left periphery. This paper provides independent evidence from attitude dative constructions in Levantine Arabic in support of this approach. Attitude datives are optional pronominal elements that make pragmatic contributions to utterances without altering their meaning. The paper shows that attitude datives whose referent coincides with the referent of the subject are less restricted in terms of the interpretation they may receive in imperative versus other types of clauses. Imperative clauses are more permissive, a characteristic that follows from the special status of their subject.","['arabic', 'datives', 'imperatives', 'addressee', 'adjuncts', 'countercyclic merge', 'cyclic merge', 'syntax']",2020

The morphosyntactic complexities in Arabic exceptives cast doubt on the adequacy of previous analyses that exceptive particles are prepositions, focal adverbs, or coordinating conjunctions, and they also lead the paper to argue for more principled accounts in which exceptive particles are analyzed as functional heads that project into an ExP ‘exceptive phrase’ which exists in two distinct configurations. The first includes an exceptive marker carrying [Acc-Case] ‘accusative case’ and [DS] ‘domain subtraction’ features when the ExP is an adjunct introduced by late Merge. The second includes a negative determiner which selects and c-commands the exceptive particle and deactivates/ suspends its [Acc-Case], consequently, the case feature of the ExP-complement is valued by percolation from D which combines with the exceptive marker to form a discontinuous focus particle with a [DR] ‘domain restriction’ feature.","['adjunction', 'case valuation', 'conjunction', 'ellipsis', 'exception', 'feature percolation', 'negation', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

Under an analysis of sluicing with syntactic identity between antecedent and ellipsis site, such examples require preposition stranding in the ellipsis site. We call this pattern OPUS, which the reader is invited to interpret as an abbreviation, depending on their theoretical predilections, as Ostensible P-stranding Under Sluicing or as Omission of Preposition Under Sluicing. Our findings show that Saudi Arabic violates Merchant’s (2001) second form identity generalization. Further experiments reveal that the status of the examples depends on the status of the most acceptable synonymous source within the ellipsis site; in particular, when neither a cleft structure nor a resumptive structure are grammatically available in the ellipsis site, the acceptability of OPUS decays. We interpret this as evidence that there is syntactic structure at the ellipsis site and that the wh-remnant in these elliptical questions can – and sometimes must – relate to a resumptive pronoun in the ellipsis site.","['sluicing', 'preposition stranding', 'preposition omission', 'resumptive pronouns', 'ellipsis', 'arabic', 'syntax']",2020
On the impossibility of furthest conjunct agreement: Evidence from Arabic,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004773/current.pdf?_s=b83ZmjRsHFuc7M3F,"['Al-Khalaf, Eman']","Recent work has revealed that conjunct agreement is affected by linear order: it is the conjunct
closest to the agreeing element that values the agreement features of that element. More
recently, however, researchers have introduced a new form of agreement that challenges this
generalization, namely highest conjunct agreement in preverbal position, where agreement occurs
with the furthest conjunct. In this squib, I present an apparently similar form of agreement
from Modern Standard Arabic and argue that this form of agreement is not conjunct agreement;
it is rather agreement with a comitative. If this conclusion is on the right track, it calls for further
investigation of furthest conjunct agreement in the other languages, given that, as reported
in the literature, furthest conjunct agreement is less preferred than the other agreement options
and given that it is not attested in the nominal domain although closest conjunct agreement is.
If furthest conjunct agreement turns out to be not real, this provides support for the generalization
that conjunct agreement is strictly a linear phenomenon, lending support to the view
that linear order can be computed in the narrow syntax instead of solely being a part of the
post-syntactic component.","['coordination', 'conjunct agreement', 'furthest conjunct agreement', 'comitatives', 'linear order', 'modern standard arabic', 'syntax']",2019
Floating Quantifiers are Autonomous Phrases: A Movement Account,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004145/current.pdf?_s=jFGXr1Xk1qfN4ieG,"['Al-Khalaf, Eman']","Q-float is a phenomenon in which a quantifier is separated from
the nominal it associates with (The cookies will all have been eaten up by
then!). The phenomenon has received two major analyses: stranding and
adjunction. The stranding analysis argues that the associate moves leftward
out of a complex constituent that contains both it and the floating
quantifier. The adjunction analysis considers floating quantifiers to be
adverbial adjuncts. This paper investigates Q-float in Arabic and shows
that neither of the existing accounts perfectly captures the facts. Adopting
Ott’s (2012; 2015) analysis of split topics and Q-float in German, the
paper proposes that in Arabic, a floating quantifier and its associate are
merged together in a particular syntactic position as a set of autonomous
phrases; the associate moves out of the set to allow the set to be labeled
and integrated in the structure. It will be shown that this labeling analysis
captures many of the peculiarities of Q-float, among which are two
apparently conflicting facts: the locality restrictions on floating quantifiers
and, in many cases, the impossibility for the floating quantifier and
the associate to have formed a continuous constituent at any stage of
the derivation. The facts and analysis presented contribute to the debate
on whether floating quantifiers mark the positions of lower copies
of displaced nominals (NP traces in pre-minimalist terms), providing an
argument that, at least for Arabic, the answer is ‘yes’. It also provides additional
support for the labeling framework that emerged from Chomsky

"Modality, Control and Restructuring in Arabic [PhD thesis]",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004611/current.pdf?_s=SR9SHYuB0jF1Junx,"['Albaty, Yasser']","The dissertation examines theories of modality and control with data from Standard Arabic (SA). In particular, I show that complementations of particular modal and control verbs in SA are not clausal, but smaller phrases. This challenges proposed accounts in the literature of modality in SA as well as theories of control within Minimalism. I alternatively argue for a novel account of both constructions that posits a monoclausal (i.e., restructuring) structure.
	First, Chapter 2 investigates modality verbs in SA and shows that subjunctive complements of modality do not exhibit the properties of clausal complementation. I examine the syntax-semantics properties of modality which reveal insights into the structure of modality. I argue that modality verbs are situated based on their semantic denotation. In this respect, I show that SA provides novel arguments to the long-held assumption that epistemic modality is high while root modality is low. Previously-unnoticed data are also discussed where it is shown that morphosyntactic properties comply with semantic restrictions that are independently motivated. Hence, I propose that modal verbs in SA have discrete positions in the clause structure and that they do not all target the same syntactic position. I discuss several arguments for this claim including Cinque’s (2001, 2006) hierarchy and its relative ordering. I present a novel analysis that posits that modality in SA is a restructuring (monoclausal) structure.
	The second part of the dissertation examines recent theories of control in Minimalism and argues that SA provides a new intriguing challenge in various theoretical and empirical aspects. In particular, I show that various empirical issues arise with the Movement Theory of Control (Hornstein, 2001; Boeckx and Hornstein, 2006, Hornstein et al., 2010), the Agree Theory of Control (Landau, 2000, 2004, 2006), and the Functional Theory of Control (Cinque, 2001, 2006; Grano, 2012).  In Chapter 3, I establish that SA has obligatory control and examine the two types of control classified after Landau (2000). I argue that both Partial Control (PC) and Exhaustive Control (EC) obtain in SA. I propose a biclausal (i.e., non-restructuring) analysis for PC that postulates an embedded null syntactic subject (i.e., PRO). 
	In Chapters 4 and 5, I provide a battery of restructuring diagnostics that show that EC in SA is restructuring and pose an enormous challenge to contrasting analyses. The chapters discuss various issues that pertain to theories of control and finite control crosslinguistically. In particular, it is shown that control theories that postulate biclausal constructions for EC make untenable predications and are thus empirically challenged. I propose a new restructuring analysis for EC in SA that derives its properties and does not encounter the empirical challenges observed with other theories. The proposed account has crosslinguistic consequences and also sheds new lights into the discrepancies between forward and backward control.

For this purpose, the empirical basis of the paper is a stronghold of moraic theory: stress in Palestinian Arabic, with its rich interplay of syllable structure and stress assignment, involving quantity sensitivity, a syllabically-determined stress shift and metrically-conditioned long vowel shortening. Showcasing the innovative grid-based notion of weight incorporation in Ulfsbjorninn (2014), the account provided recognizes only one unit relevant for meter: the nucleus. No appeal is made to moras, syllables, feet or extrametricality. Besides these principled advantages over the traditional moraic account, it is shown that metrical vowel shortening is much more simply explained in the present framework than in the moraic account, and can also explain final vowel shortening. The analysis is also brought to bear on Cairene Arabic, which in our analysis differs from Palestinian in a single parameter setting.  Finally, the paper also improves on previous analyses of meter in Strict CV, as for the first time in Strict CV metrics, a computational component is explicitly formalized.

Although the pronominal system in SA includes pronouns declining for person, gender, number and case, morphological syncretism exists where gender is not contrastive in the 1st person pronouns plus the dual pronouns. Moreover, case does not show distinct realizations in the accusative/genitive pronouns. The paper shows that the under-specification of vocabulary items can account for all the pronominal patterns. However, two syntax-independent mechanisms are needed to account for problematic bimorphemic pronouns: Fission (Noyer, 1997) and Impoverishment (Bonet, 1991). In this paper, fission is proposed in a rule-governed format, where a node is split into two nodes: the first node bears the case/person features while the other bears the number/gender features. As for the syncretism in the case of the 3rd person pronouns and in the gender of the dual pronouns, they are accounted for by two contextualized impoverishment rules: the first rule involves the deletion of case features, whereas the other deletes the gender features. Both impoverishment rules are operative in the 3rd person dual pronouns and they occur in a non-restrictive order.","['standard arabic', 'pronouns', 'distributed morphology', 'impoverishment', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

Two views have been contrasted in the literature: the Low-Neg analysis, according to which Neg is the complement of TP, and the High-Neg analysis whereby Neg is higher than T. In this study, I will argue that while the two views account form a good range of empirical facts, Low-Neg analysis lacks empirical adequacy. Similarly, the High-Neg view is hard to reconcile within the Spec-head agreement and the standard Agree approach. However, I will show that the High-Neg analysis can be still maintained under the Feature-Inheritance approach, in which T inherits its ø-features and Tense feature from C.

I propose an analysis of NPI licensing in which three components of grammar interface: syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Semantics defines the class of NPI licensors, pragmatics forces quantificational closure of NPIs, and syntax executes the licensing via AGREE between a phasal head and the NPI.

Based on previous work, it is argued that Moroccan Arabic has lost the Classical Arabic short vowels and has developed a short central vowel, used break up illicit consonant clusters. It is shown that the distribution of this schwa-like vowel is better analysed within a strict CV model where ungoverned empty vocalic positions surface at the phonetic level. In the same vein, it is proposed that the Classical Arabic short [u] is kept in Moroccan Arabic as a labial feature when it occurs in the vicinity of a labial, velar or uvular consonant. Sibilant harmony is another feature that Moroccan Arabic shares with Amazigh. It is analysed as a long distance process which occurs within a specific domain, consisting of the stem template, plus an empty initial CV. This empty site allows for the Moroccan Arabic definite article and the Amazigh causative prefix to harmonize with the stem sibilant. The influence of Amazigh on Moroccan Arabic is also visible at the morphological level.

In this paper, we diverge from this trend, claiming that the two approaches suffer from a lack of empirical adequacy. As an alternative, we propose an analysis within the theory of Optimality Theory, with the basic assumption being that the linearization of the causative morpheme is instead the result of phonological well-formedness interacting with the morphological process of causativization. An important empirical prediction of our analysis is that the causative affix can neither move to word-initial positions nor word-final positions under the pressure of phonological well-formedness constraints. This is shown to be an example of the Emergence of the Unmarked, wherein the otherwise inactive markedness constraint *COMPLEXONSET in the language bears the burden of the explanation.

I investigate three FCA-languages (Arabic, Biblical Hebrew, and Welsh), and argue that FCA is an illusion: it is not the first conjunct that values agreement. Alternatively, I propose that a null pro values its unvalued features by agreeing with the linearly closest NP before it Agrees with the verb in a left to right derivational model, resulting in what appears to be illusive conjunct agreement. The proposal leads to the conclusion that FCA as in Welsh is actually not conjunct agreement; there is real conjunct agreement, but it is always closest conjunct agreement.","['coordination', 'conjunct agreement', 'linear order', 'little pro']",2017
Temporal/locative inversion in Arabic,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003375/current.pdf?_s=c3K3ocKDhZ6H9smu,"['Jarrah, Marwan']","This research scrutinizes the observation that when the thematic subject is extracted (i.e. questioned) in Jordanian Arabic, temporal/locative inversion may occur. Temporal inversion occurs irrespective of the verb being transitive or intransitive, whereas locative inversion is limited to contexts with an intransitive verb. This research argues that this distinction correlates with the base-generation of temporal/locative adjuncts; temporal adjuncts are base-generated adjoining TP, whereas locatives are base-generated adjoining VP. Temporal but not locative adjuncts resist fronting with vP, demand the use of a tense copula (or a tensed verb), and are not subject to deletion along with the lexical verb. With the assumption that Spec, SubjP must be filled by a non-silent copy due to the effects of Subject Criterion (Rizzi and Shlonsky 2007), a temporal or locative adjunct, if any, fills this position instead of the extracted thematic subject. Given its low position, a locative adjunct is accessible to Subj0 only when there is no v*P, hence the account of the correlation between locative inversion and verb valency. Furthermore, this research explores existence of temporal/locative inversion in other two Arabic dialects, arguing for a micro-parametric view of this strategy across Arabic dialects.

The analysis draws on an English-translated 89-word list extracted from Wolof-French Dictionary (Diouf, 2003). In TCRS framework, the Threshold Principle stipulates that an ill-formed segment can be universally adapted with 2 repairs, otherwise it will be completely deleted, e.g., Fula, a Senegalese language, requires only two repairs for loanword adaptation (Paradis & LaCharite, 1997).

Linear order between the L-verb, the DO, and any accompanying adjuncts is assumed, among others, to be evidence supporting this contention.

morphophonological constraints. These constraints are responsible for the linearization of the

These structures feature a nominal or pronominal element – in this case, him – that functions semantically as the possessor of a separate DP – eye – and syntactically as a dependent of the verb. Syntactic approaches to possessive dative constructions in such languages as Hebrew and German argue for a movement analysis in which the possessor starts out in the possessum DP before moving to a higher position. Semantic approaches to the same phenomenon in German and French, among other languages, analyze possessive dative constructions as instances of anaphoric binding; the dative undergoes first-merge outside the possessum DP and binds a variable in it. The present article documents and analyzes what appear to be instances of possessive dative constructions in Lebanese Arabic.

While Set Merge is contingent on the feature specifications of the heads of the two merging elements, the Merge Condition on Adjuncts states that an adjunct must merge in accordance with the feature specifications of its own head. Two edge features are available: [+ Predicational] and [- Predicational]. Only the former forces the adjunct to function as an open predicate and to establish a predication dependency – or a subject-predicate relation – with an element in the matrix clause. This requirement is syntactic, and it overrides the semantic specifications of adjuncts. Support comes from adjunct control into circumstantial clauses in Lebanese Arabic.","['adjunction – arabic – control – movement – structural theory of predication', 'syntax']",2016

The degree to which phonology controls the word shape and nonconcatenative morphological alternations in these languages has been up for debate ever since the first autosegmental account of Arabic morphology related the two by mapping morphemes non linearly onto stored prosodic templates (McCarthy 1981). This article, however, argues that seemingly nonconcantenative morphology is indeed best represented concatenatively as discrete phonological pieces realizing morphosyntactic features. The resulting morphophonological effects can be separated from prosodic factors that affect the entire word. In support of this hypothesis, I examine locality effects in allomorphy selection and the interaction of morphophonological and phonological processes in the Semitic languages Arabic and
Akkadian, showing that in both cases, apparently nonconcatenative morphemes in fact show structural sensitivity, which can only be captured in a piece based theory of morphology where realization of syntactic features is separate from phonological constraints.","['nonconcatenative templatic morphology', 'morphophonological lengthening', 'arabic', 'akkadian', 'locality', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2013

I investigate every process of place assimilation in these two varieties, and show that the analysis of an individual phenomenon must be congruent with that of the overall sound system. In the analysis, phonological features are treated as abstract (substance-free) categories that “emerge” to the learner from the language’s surface patterns; that is to say, they are neither universal nor genetically pre-determined. This stems from the belief that phonology and phonetics are two independent domains, though resembling each other in obvious ways. The empirical contribution of the thesis is to provide in-depth descriptions of all instances of place assimilation in these two varieties of Arabic, based on an extensive amount of first-hand data. These data are presented and carefully examined, uncovering new and interesting facts about the patterns, and also holding implications for the wider context of Arabic dialectology. The theoretical contribution is two-fold. First, the thesis offers new solutions to a number of representational and computational challenges in the analysis of place assimilation. Second, it offers an exposition and implementation of a recently developed comprehensive theory of feature geometry—the Parallel Structures Model. This model provides a minimalist and coherent account of consonant-vowel interactions within a unified analysis of the complete sound system.

The first was to critically evaluate existing proposals for the syntactic structure of restrictive relative clauses with definite and indefinite heads in English and Latakian Syrian Arabic (a colloquial dialect of Arabic), and to select those proposals which provide the best fit for the facts of English and for the facts of Latakian Syrian Arabic. The second goal was to contribute to the development of a theory of second language acquisition by investigating how speakers of Latakian Syrian Arabic acquire English definite and indefinite RRCs. Since this is the first study of the structure of restrictive relative clauses in Latakian Syrian Arabic, an important first task was to collect grammatical intuitional data from native speakers of that variety. Based on the findings, and the well-known properties of restrictive relative clauses in English, it was argued that the account that best fits the data of English is the traditional operator movement analysis, while for Latakian Syrian Arabic a clitic left-dislocation account offers the best fit. Assuming this analysis, the acquisition of restrictive relative clauses in English by speakers of Latakian Syrian Arabic was investigated using a quasi-longitudinal design. Learners of elementary, lower intermediate, upper intermediate and advanced proficiency (as measured by an independent proficiency test) completed a grammaticality judgement task, a guided gap-filling task and a translation task. Results show first language influence at early stages of learning on some properties, but not all. There is also persistent influence of the first language in later stages of learning, but specifically on properties that involve uninterpretable features. Interpretable features appear to have been fully acquired. The implications of these findings for theories of second language acquisition are considered.",['1521 times'],2013
Hebrew and Arabic Definiteness Marking as Post-Syntactic Local Dislocation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001589/current.pdf?_s=74KHKkIbDPhsiQ-p,"['McNabb, Yaron']","Hebrew and Arabic attributive adjectives agree in definiteness with the nouns they modify in addition to their agreement in gender and number. Previous studies consist of two competing accounts for the definiteness agreement. Under the first account, the definite marker _ha_ is a D head selecting the adjective it marks for definiteness (similarly to nouns) (e.g. Sichel 2002); under the second account, the definite marker is a syntactic definiteness feature inherent to the noun or determiner, which spreads to other elements in the DP (e.g. Borer 1996).

In this paper, I present novel data from degree modification of coordinated adjectives in Hebrew and Arabic. I show that the scope ambiguities and definiteness marking patterns in various structures provide evidence for an analysis whereby definiteness is a syntactic feature that surfaces as the phrasal clitic _ha-_ ‘the’. In addition, I show that the structure-sensitive, though post-syntactic, morphological operation of LOCAL DISLOCATION generates the correct distribution of the Hebrew and Arabic definite marker, namely it being a phrasal proclitic occurring at the left-edge of phrases, as well as the intricate pattern of definiteness agreement in Hebrew and Arabic attributive adjectives.","['coordination', 'local dislocation', 'adjectives', 'degree modifiers', 'definite marker', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

Investigations in a Simplified Bracketed Grid Approach to Metrical Structure,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001166/current.pdf?_s=r_mpX2hn5Iau2zw0,"['Liu, Patrick']","In this dissertation, I examine the fundamental mechanisms and assumptions of the Simplified Bracketed Grid Theory (Idsardi 1992) in two ways: first, by comparing it with Parametric Metrical Theory (Hayes 1995), and second, by implementing it in the analysis of several case studies in stress assignment and syllabification. Throughout these investigations, I argue for Simplified Bracketed Grid Theory as the superior theory of metrical structure.

In Simplified Bracketed Grid Theory (SBG), metrical grids are constructed derivationally through the application of rules which can insert or delete brackets and grid marks. This can be contrasted with Parametric Metrical Theory (PMT), which builds up metrical grids using binary feet as metrical building blocks. In Chapters 2 and 3 of the dissertation, I draw out the implications of this fundamental difference between these two theories of metrical phonology, paying attention in particular to the range of attested stress systems which each theory can account for and the complexity of the resulting accounts.

Three areas of comparison are examined in detail: foot parsing, the inventory of metrical feet, and the status of the foot as a prosodic unit, as evidenced by foot extrametricality. In every case, I argue that SBG provides a level of internal consistency and simplicity which cannot be found in PMT. A more concrete picture of the strengths of the SBG theory is presented by means of multiple case studies of stress assignment and syllabification (Arabic dialects in Chapter 4, and the Algonquian language Passamaquoddy in Chapter 5). In addition, the SBG formalism is extended in two ways: first, to apply to issues of syllabification, and second, to deal with stress systems which refer to more than two categories of syllable weight. The flexibility of SBG in being able to account not only for complex stress systems, but also for areas of phonology outside of stress assignment (i.e., syllabification) is taken to be an argument in its favor.","['metrical phonology', 'bracketed grid', 'stress', 'syllabification', 'extrametricality', 'foot structure', 'finite state machines', 'arabic', 'passamaquoddy', 'phonology']",2010

Deletion that removes the offending structure renders that comparative structure grammatical (Kennedy & Merchant 2000).



In this study, we draw attention to the complexity of the configurational relations between the noun and adjective(s), thereby contributing to the study of the internal structure of the Arabic DP.

Question Formation between the Minimalist Program and Optimality Theory,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001291/current.pdf?_s=oQ0xpzeALAr7J5St,"['El-Touny, Kariema']","The purpose of this study was to investigate the construction of
questions in English and Cairene Arabic (CA) using the Minimalist
Program (MP) and Optimality Theory (OT) as two opposing views
on how questions are formed and analyzed in both of these
languages.
The dialect used in this thesis, CA, is one which is discussed
briefly in the literature, only it is Egyptian Arabic (EA) that is
mentioned. There aren’t many references that mention CA and
seldom ones that mention the optionality of wh- phrases found in
it. CA as a dialect has proven to be one which is rich in it’s
analysis of question formation. The analysis of optionality of the
wh- phrase, both in MP and OT, is the contribution this researcher
is trying to provide to the academic research.
The Minimalist Program and Optimality Theory are used as the
methods of research. These two competing theories use different
approaches in describing and analyzing question formation. The
Minimalist Program relies on feature checking to account for the
movement of any element in the sentence. The uninterpretable
feature of one element, called the Probe, needs to be checked by
another element, called the Goal. A way of checking this feature
comes in the form of movement of the Goal to a position where it
can get into a checking relation with the Probe.
Optimality Theory focuses on the satisfaction of high- ranked
constraints in a typology that is language- specific. Every sentence
used grammatically in any language is the winning candidate in a
II
competition aimed at choosing that optimal form. The criterion
used is a set of constraints; these constraints are ranked in a
typological hierarchy that changes cross- linguistically. The
constraints are general and universal. If one constraint is lowranked,
it can be violated by the winning candidate and the status
of the optimal form’s integrity is not compromised. As long as the
higher- ranked constraint(s) are satisfied, then any violation of
lower- ranked constraint(s) is tolerable within standard OT
analysis.
The thesis is divided into three chapters, and a conclusion.
Chapter one is the introduction where a short history of both
theories is given along with their structure and respective
components in details. Chapter two discusses question formation in
the Minimalist Program. In this chapter, English and Cairene
Arabic are the main languages of analysis. Every type of
interrogatives in both of these languages is analyzed and trees are
drawn when needed. Examples from Iraqi Arabic and Hindi are
introduced. Chapter three begins with a detailed account of the
steps taken to achieve an OT analysis. It then discusses the
optimality- theoretic approach to question formation. Also, English
and Cairene Arabic are the main languages of analysis; tableaux of
the competitions are drawn when needed. The final section is the
conclusion where the results of this research study are provided. At

We concentrate on the shapes occurring in Germanic and argue for a unified movement analysis which distinguishes contrastive left dislocation from hanging topic left dislocation in that only the former involves Agree on top of Match between the left dislocate and the resuming pronominal. Under such an approach, the variety in shapes and properties observed breaks down to a tight similarity from which the diverging patterns fall out in a straightforward fashion.","['left dislocation', 'german', 'dutch', 'arabic', 'movement', 'resumption', 'copy spell out', 'syntax']",2004
