A stripy wug-shaped curves in sound symbolism,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005476/current.pdf?_s=7zlDbEXY32qS_VUg,"['Kawahara, Shigeto']","In recent years, Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar (MaxEnt HG) has been successfully applied to model various linguistic patterns. Building on these studies, the current experiment examines its quantitative signatures, typical probabilistic patterns that this framework is predicted to generate Hayes (2020). Given a linear scale of violations of one constraint, MaxEnt yields a sigmoid curve. When another constraint is relevant, this sigmoid curve can be shifted, yielding two sigmoid curves, which together look like a wug, our beloved animal in the linguistics community. When the second constraint can be violated more than once, MaxEnt predicts that it yields a set of multiple sigmoid curves separated from one another, resulting in a ""stripy wug-shaped curve."" The current experiment demonstrates that we observe a stripy wug-shaped curve in patterns of sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. Concretely, the experiment shows that the judgment of Pokémons' evolution status is cumulatively affected by the mora counts of nonce names, resulting in a sigmoid curve, and that this sigmoid curve can be shifted according to the number of voiced obstruents contained in the names. This paper concludes that MaxEnt HG is a useful framework to model sound-meaning mappings, and suggests that there may be a meaningful parallel between sound symbolic patterns and probabilistic phonological patterns.

Sound symbolic patterns in Pokémon move names,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003742/current.pdf?_s=9UKnQ7nUMcYDAOEB,"['Kawahara, Shigeto']","In recent years, we have witnessed a dramatically growing interest in sound symbolism, systematic associations between sounds and meanings. A recent case study of sound symbolism shows that in Pokémon games, longer names are generally associated with stronger Pokémon characters, and moreover those Pokémon characters with names having more voiced obstruents are generally stronger (Kawahara et al., 2018b). The current study examined the productivity of these sound symbolic effects in the names of the moves that Pokémon creatures use when they battle. The analysis of the existing move names shows that the effect of name length on attack values is robust, and that the effect of voiced obstruents is tangible. These sound symbolic patterns hold, despite the fact that most (= 99%) move names are based on real words in Japanese. An additional experiment with nonce names shows that both of these effects are very robust. Overall, the current paper adds to the growing body of studies showing that the relationships between sounds and meanings are not as arbitrary as modern linguistic theories have standardly assumed. Uniquely, the current analysis of the existing move names shows that such non-arbitrary relationships can hold even when the set of words under consideration are mostly existing words (Shih & Rudin, 2019; Sidhu et al., 2019).

Exploring sound symbolic knowledge of English speakers using Pokemon character names,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004143/current.pdf?_s=x8mQLulVXQ-LqHum,"['Kawahara, Shigeto', 'Moore, Jeff']","This paper is a contribution to the studies of sound symbolism, systematic relationships between sounds and meanings. Two experiments were conducted in which native speakers of English were provided with pairs of pre-evolution and post-evolution Pokemon characters, the latter of which were always larger. The participants were given two name choices whose members are systematically different in some phonological properties. The results show the following sound symbolic patterns to be productive: the participants tend to associate post-evolution characters with (1) names containing voiced obstruents ([b, d, g, z]), (2) names with more segments, (3) names containing [a], (4) names containing [u], and (5) names containing coronal consonants. Overall, the current results suggest that phonological properties of names non-trivially affect the naming patterns of new creatures, implying that the relationships between sounds and meanings are not as arbitrary as modern linguistic theories generally assume.","['sound symbolism', 'english', 'voicing', 'iconicity of quantity', 'pokemonastics!', 'phonology']",2018
Expressing Evolution in Pokemon Names: Experimental Explorations,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003281/current.pdf?_s=hr_oxo5jVgf-Xrcv,"['Kawahara, Shigeto', 'Kumagai, Gakuji']","There has been a growing body of interests in sound symbolic patterns in natural languages, in which some sounds are associated with particular meanings. As a case study, a previous corpus-based research identified some specific sound symbolic relationships in Pokemon naming patterns in Japanese [1]. One of the main findings was that the names of Pokemon characters are more likely to contain voiced obstruents and are longer in terms of mora counts, when they undergo evolution (e.g. /nyoromo/ => /nyorobon/; /poppo/ => /pijotto/.). The current study reports three experiments that test whether (i) these patterns are productive in the minds of general Japanese speakers (Experiments 1 and 2), and whether (ii) the same tendency would hold with English speakers (Experiment 3). The results show that the effect of mora length was clearly observed both with Japanese speakers and English speakers; the effects of voiced obstruents were observed clearly with Japanese speakers, and less clearly with English speakers. Further analyses show that familiarity with Pokemon may influence their responses, suggesting the possibility that speakers can learn sound-symbolic patterns from a particular set of lexical items (i.e. “the Pokemon lexicon”). Besides its research value, we argue that this general project can be useful for undergraduate phonetics education.

Sound (Symbolic) Patterns in Pokemon Names: Focusing on Voiced Obstruents and Mora Counts,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003196/current.pdf?_s=or4EqP0ThV0Of97K,"['Kawahara, Shigeto', 'Noto, Atsushi', 'Kumagai, Gakuji']","This paper presents a case study of sound symbolism, cases in which certain sounds tend to be associated with particular meanings. We use the corpus of all Pokemon names available as of October 2016.

We tested the effects of voiced obstruents, mora counts, and vowel quality on Pokemon characters' size, weight, strength parameters, and evolution levels. We found that the number of voiced obstruents in Pokemon names correlates positively with size, weight, evolution levels, and general strength parameters, except for speed. We argue that this result is compatible with the Frequency Code Hypothesis. The number of moras in Pokemon names correlates positively with size, weight, evolution levels and all strength parameters. 

Vowel height is also shown to have an influence on size and weight---Pokemon characters with initial high vowels tend to be smaller and lighter, although the effect size is not very large.

Not only does this paper offer a new case study of sound symbolism, it provides evidence that sound symbolism is at work when naming proper nouns. In general, the materials provided in this paper are useful for undergraduate education in linguistics, phonetics and psychology to attract students' interests, as Pokemon is very popular among current students.","['sound symbolism', 'japanese', 'phonetics', 'voiced obstruents', 'mora counts', 'pokemon', 'phonology']",2017
Degrees as kinds vs. degrees as numbers: Evidence from equatives,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005249/current.pdf?_s=GnGmJgYQO6XqEKjJ,"['Zhang, Linmin']","Within formal semantics, there are two views with regard to the ontological status of degrees: the ‘degree-as-number’ view (e.g., Seuren, 1973; Hellan, 1981; von Stechow, 1984) and the ‘degree-as-kind’ view (e.g., Anderson and Morzycki, 2015). Based on (i) empirical distinctions between comparatives and equatives and (ii) Stevens’s (1946) theory on the four levels of measurements, I argue that both views are motivated and needed in accounting for measurement- and comparison-related meanings in natural language. Specifically, I argue that since the semantics of comparatives potentially involves measurable differences, comparatives need to be analyzed based on scales with units, on which degrees are like (real) numbers. In contrast, since equatives are typically used to convey the non-existence of differences, equatives can be based on scales without units, on which degrees can be considered kinds.

"Loose Talk, Scale Presuppositions and QUD",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004909/current.pdf?_s=W_pIvkTXRs1cf5n6,"['Hoek, Daniel']","I present a new pragmatic theory of loose talk, focussing on the loose use of numbers and measurement expressions. The account explains loose readings as arising from a pragmatic mechanism aimed at restoring relevance to the question under discussion (QUD), appealing to Krifka's notion of a measurement scale. The core motivating observation is that the loose reading of a claim need not be weaker than its literal content, as almost all pragmatic treatments of loose talk have assumed (e.g. Lasersohn). The loosening mechanism described here can be applied to a range of other linguistic phenomena as well.","['loose talk', 'numbers', 'qud', 'presuppositions', 'relevance', 'formal pragmatics', 'semantics']",2019
Abstract Objects and the Core-Periphery Distinction in the Ontological and the Conceptual Domain of Natural Language,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004840/current.pdf?_s=J9R2dhM-axdeJtMS,"['Moltmann, Friederike']","This paper elaborates core-periphery distinctions in the ontological and the conceptual domain of natural language. The core-periphery distinction is essential for the pursuit of natural language ontology and has in fact been made implicitly by any philosopher present or past when appealing to natural language for motivating an ontological notion or view. The distinction plays a central role in the main thesis of my 2013 book Abstract Objects and the Semantics of Natural Language, that natural language permits reference to abstract objects only in its periphery, not its core. The paper explores how the core-periphery distinction relevant for ontology appears to be structurally anchored and relate to the more familiar core-periphery distinction that Chomsky drew for syntax","['abstract objects', 'core-periphery distinction', 'propositions', 'properties', 'numbers', 'degrees', 'functional categories', 'semantics', 'syntax']",2019
The Faculty of Language Integrates the Two Core Systems of Number,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005462/current.pdf?_s=UEI_BtiVwpz82FQm,"['Hiraiwa, Ken']","Only humans possess the faculty of language that allows an infinite array of hierarchically structured expressions (Hauser et al., 2002; Berwick and Chomsky, 2015). Similarly, humans have a capacity for infinite natural numbers, while all other species seem to lack such a capacity (Gelman and Gallistel, 1978; Dehaene, 1997). Thus, the origin of this numerical capacity and its relation to language have been of much interdisciplinary interest in developmental and behavioral psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and linguistics (Dehaene, 1997; Hauser et al., 2002; Pica et al., 2004). Hauser et al. (2002) and Chomsky (2008) hypothesize that a recursive generative operation that is central to the computational system of language (called Merge) can give rise to the successor function in a set-theoretic fashion, from which capacities for discretely infinite natural numbers may be derived. However, a careful look at two domains in language, grammatical number and numerals, reveals no trace of the successor function. Following behavioral and neuropsychological evidence that there are two core systems of number cognition innately available, a core system of representation of large, approximate numerical magnitudes and a core system of precise representation of distinct small numbers (Feigenson et al., 2004), I argue that grammatical number reflects the core system of precise representation of distinct small numbers alone. In contrast, numeral systems arise from integrating the pre-existing two core systems of number and the human language faculty. To the extent that my arguments are correct, linguistic representations of number, grammatical number, and numerals do not incorporate anything like the successor function.","['natural language', 'number', 'natural numbers', 'numerals', 'core systems of number', 'grammatical number', 'syntax', 'linguistics', 'syntax']",2017
"'The Number of Planets', a Number-Referring Term?",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003242/current.pdf?_s=3o0-yY1btoVKhfwF,"['Moltmann, Friederike']","The paper argues that Frege was mistaken in taking 'the number of planets' to be a term referring to a number as an abstract object. 'The number of planets' either functions as a term standing for a number trope, the manifestation of being eight in the plurality of the planets, or else it is the subject of a specificational sentence and does not function as a referential term at all. The latter is the case in 'The number of planets is eight'. In a specificational sentence, 'the number of planets' stands for the question 'how many planets are there', not involving reference to a number object.","['numbers', 'tropes', 'specificational sentences', 'semantics']",2016
"Sapir, Harris and Chomsky in the twentieth century",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001914/current.pdf?_s=1wcOrCTz-zMLgHyx,"['Abler, William']","The concept of linguistics has isolated language from other natural
systems, and linguistics has remained overwhelmingly a descriptive,
rather than a theoretical science. The idea of language universals
has thus been a matter of finding shared properties among
the highest levels in the organization of language, rather than an
attempt to understand the connections of language to other natural
systems at all levels of its organization. Language basics such as
discreteness have been treated as axiomatic or refractory. The origin
of language has been treated as an exercise in continuity, rather
than an attempt to understand the organization of language. These
trends have been driven by the personalities of Edward Sapir, Zellig
Harris and Noam Chomsky, more than by scientific considerations.
Sapir’s eagerness, Harris’s indecision, and Chomsky’s magnetism
have generated a perfect scientific storm.","['algebra', 'chomsky', 'discrete', 'evolution', 'language', 'mind', 'numbers', 'sentence', 'syntax']",2013
"Numerals, Numbers and Cognition: Towards a Localist Theory of the Mind",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001653/current.pdf?_s=iNOrn7--FoEAyGVZ,"['Krivochen, Diego', 'Miechowicz-Mathiasen, Katarzyna']","The proposal we present has a simple, yet ambitious, purpose: we attempt to show that the basis of cognition has locative nature; in other words, the foundations of complex thought are to be found in the spatial relations between entities. Such a conception of the structure of human cognition must be at the same time restricted enough to account for the representations licensed by the phenomenological world, and flexible enough to allow for the inclusion of further layers of information as required by determined faculties (all interpretative components of the mind, with neurological basis, respond to localist principles). Moreover, we claim that all variation between faculties is the result of the interpretative systems (or the absence of interpretation at all), since generation can be subsumed to a single concatenation algorithm to be applied in n-dimensional mental workspaces (Baddeley 1992; D’Espósito 2007). In language this has crucial consequences for the theory of syntax-semantics interface: generation is driven by the need to derive significant effects on the output, in particular, to increase the informational load.
We intend to show that our proposal finds support in the characteristic properties of the three generative systems represented by language, mathematics (geometry) and music, i.e. we intend to show how all three are interconnected and locative in nature. We will use numerals as the bridge between language and the musical and arithmetical capacities.","['numerals', 'compression', 'the scale of natural harmonics', 'location', 'locative', 'conceptuaization of mental space', 'syntax']",2012
Theoretical Implications of the Study of Numbers and Numerals in Mundurucu,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001700/current.pdf?_s=oHwRlmNyjyq0gVQR,"['Pica, Pierre', 'Lecomte, Alain']","Developing earlier studies of the system of numbers in Mundurucu, this paper argues that the Mundurucu numeral system is far more complex than usually assumed. The Mundurucu numeral system provides indirect but insightful arguments for a modular approach to numbers and numerals. It is argued that distinct components must be distinguished, such as a system of representation of numbers in the format of internal magnitudes, a system of representation for individuals and sets, and one-to-one correspondences between the numerosity expressed by the number and its metrics. It is shown that while many-number systems involve a compositionality of units, sets and sets composed of units, few-number languages, such as Mundurucu, do not have access to sets composed of units in the usual way. The nonconfigurational character of the Mundurucu language, which is related to a property for which we coin the term ‘low compositionality power’, accounts for this and explains the curious fact that Mundurucus make use of marked one-to-one correspondence strategies in order to overcome the limitations of the core system at the perceptual/motor interface of the language faculty. We develop an analysis of a particular construction, parallel numbers, which has not been studied before, elucidating the whole system. This analysis, we argue, sheds new light on classical philosophical, psychological and linguistic debates about numbers and numerals and their relation to language, and more particularly, sheds light on few-number languages.","['keywords: approximation', 'compositionality power', 'few-number language', 'metrics', 'mundurucu', 'parallel numbers', 'symmetry', 'weber law']",2008
