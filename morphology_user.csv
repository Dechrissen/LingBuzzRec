States in the decomposition of verbal predicates: evidence from additive operators,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005380/current.pdf?_s=d_MMq8EEdm1Q3Ne1,"['Spathas, Giorgos', 'Michelioudakis, Dimitris']","This paper proposes a new diagnostic for the detection of stative sub-events in the decomposition of verbal predicates. The diagnostic is based on a certain type of presupposition triggered by additive operators like Greek ke ‘also’, which we call Stative Presuppositions. It is argued that the generation of such Stative Presuppositions requires the existence of a syntactically accessible constituent that denotes a predicate of states that additive operators can take scope over. We investigate the distribution of Stative Presuppositions and observe that not all verbs that support inferences to a result state give rise to them. Based on this distribution we argue for a non-uniform analysis of result verbs; whereas some verbs require an event-decompositional analysis, others are better captured by scalar- and incrementality-based analyses. We cast our analysis in the framework of Distributed Morphology and propose to explain non-uniformity based on how different types of verbal roots interact with verbal functional material. Moreover, treating roots as the locus of encyclopedic information explains lexical variation in the generation of Stative Presuppositions within sub-classes of result verbs. We strengthen our conclusions by considering and rejecting alternative syntactic and semantic mechanisms for generating Stative Presuppositions. We conclude that the generation of Stative Presuppositions by additive operators is currently the most reliable diagnostic for the detection of syntactically accessible result states in verbal decomposition.

Universality and variation in language,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005575/current.pdf?_s=pQ8sgAXAcokBoRt7,"['Sigurdsson, Halldor Armann']","This article discusses language universality and language variation, and suggests that there is no feature variation in initial syntax, featural variation arising by metamorphosis under transfer from syntax to PF-morphology. In particular, it explores the Zero Hypothesis, stating that Universal Grammar, UG, only provides two building elements, Root Zero and Edge Feature Zero, zero, as they are purely structural/formal elements with no semantic content in UG. Their potential content is provided by the Concept Mine, a mind-internal but language-external department. ... It is suggested that parameters are on the externalization side of language, part of or related to the sensory-motor system, facilitating motoric learning in language acquisition.","['keywords: root zero', 'concept mine', 'simplest merge', 'tense', 'gender', 'edge features', 'edge computation', 'parameters', 'language metamorphosis', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Syntactic and lexical -ase- are distinct suffixes,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005588/current.pdf?_s=oU8TwKmz5CsJU5gI,"['de Chene, Brent']","In addition to the syntactic (inflectional) causative suffix -(s)ase-, Japanese displays a lexical (derivational) causative suffix -(a)se- (aw-ase- ‘join’, no-se- ‘place on’) whose a-zero alternation is general in the stem-level phonology. Because the UR of syntactic -(s)ase- must include the s of its post-vocalic alternant, the two suffixes necessarily have distinct phonological forms; there is thus no way to treat them as “high attachment” and “low attachment” versions of a single element. The division of labor between syntactic -(s)ase- and lexical -(a)se- invites the conclusion that no causative suffix is syntactic in some cases and lexical in others; if so, causatives pose no challenge to the position that while Japanese inflectional morphology is generated syntactically, derivational morphology involves lexical listing of stems. The conclusion that there is no causative suffix that spans the syntactic/lexical boundary is validated by showing that forms that have been taken in the literature as exemplifying lexical -(s)ase- are in fact either lexical -(a)se- or syntactic -(s)ase-. As part of this demonstration, it is shown that, with minor exceptions, verb stems in -ase- have arisen as variants of pre-existing stems in -as-, and an explanation for this ongoing process of replacement is proposed.","['japanese', 'syntactic causative', 'lexical causative', 'high/low attachment', 'blocking', 'morphology']",2020

On Sound-Meaning Correlation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005472/current.pdf?_s=4tkiYeEHw9g8M_Vw,"['Mukherji, Nirmalangshu']","The intriguing fact about human language is that neither the sound systems nor the thought systems--technically called Sensorimotor and Conceptual-intentional systems--have any significant precedence prior to the emergence of the hominid line. So, a theory of language needs to explain where they came from and how they fell into place to create the conditions for unbounded generativity. In effect, language-theory needs to explain two novel factors in the evolution of human language: word-formation and word-combination. In this context, the recent proposal that the sound component of language is 'ancillary', and that language is basically designed for thought, is problematic. This is because the proposal turns the origin of the rich structure of human thought into a mystery since the units of human thought could not have been borrowed from, say, the apes. To look for an alternative explanation, we study Darwin's idea that (a) the sound system might have evolved in part from a pre-existing human music system, (b) the evolving sound systems might have 'acted on' rudimentary units of thought systems to turn them into words. We critically evaluate Darwin's picture. In the process, we locate the gaps in Darwin's story that must be filled to reach a more complete theory of language.","['language evolution', 'sound system', 'sound ancillary hypothesis', 'thought system', 'generativity', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

On the surface, we show that such allomorphy is long-distant. However, we argue that allomorphy respects 'relativized adjacency'(Toosarvandani 2016) or tier-based locality (Aksënova et al. 2016). Specifically, allomorphy is sensitive to the interaction between multiple morphemes which are not linearly or structurally adjacent.

This paper discusses a case of optimizing PCSA in Yindjibarndi (Pama-Nyungan, Wordick 1982), proposes an analysis in which suppletive allomorphy precedes regular phonology, and shows that the alternative – an analysis in which PCSA occurs in the phonological component of the grammar – is likely unworkable.","['suppletion', 'allomorphy', 'phonotactics', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2020

Most segmental phonology and concatenative morphology are  computationally local and characterized  by the class of  Input Strictly Local functions. We generalize these functions to consider multiple inputs, i.e.  Multi-Input Strictly Local. We implement this approach using multi-tape automata, and find that they elegantly characterize the bulk of nonlinear suprasegmental phonology and morphology. We demonstrate these results for both tonal phonology and template-filling patterns in root-and-pattern morphology. We show that locality is affected by some theoretical choices (directionality, tier-conflation), but not others (phonological content of templates). For prosodic morphology, nuanced representational choices can affect locality. The flexibility and precision given by the mathematical theory of formal languages provides precise discussion of the nuances of phonological and morphological complexity and substance in a theory-independent but rigorous way.

Case matching and syncretism in ATB dependencies,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002912/current.pdf?_s=o0Vvjo7TzC2qPz9y,"['Hein, Johannes', 'Murphy, Andrew']","Syncretism has been reported to have the peculiar property of repairing violations of syntactic constraints, e.g. with agreement (Schütze 2003, Bhatt & Walkow 2013) and case matching (Citko 2005, van Craenenbroeck 2012). This paper puts forward the view that in one well-reported instance of syncretism repair of case-matching violations with ATB-movement, this repair follows directly from the nature of ATB movement. We pursue a novel movement-based analysis that has proven to be a marginal approach in the ATB literature; ATB movement involves the actual
fusion of two syntactic objects, via intersection of feature sets, resulting in a single new object. 
As well as deriving the one-to-many relation between fillers and gaps in ATB, we show how the `repair' effect of syncretism with case matching
violations follows naturally once this mechanism of ATB is assumed.","['syncretism', 'atb', 'case matching', 'polish', 'intersection', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Gender asymmetries in ellipsis: an experimental comparison of markedness and frequency accounts in English,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005545/current.pdf?_s=T5Am9h01mm7sQ3ZK,"['Sprouse, Jon', 'Messick, Troy', 'Bobaljik, Jonathan']","Bobaljik & Zocca (2011) argue that ellipsis reveals the existence of (at least) two classes of gender-paired nouns, distinguished by the relationship between morphological marking and semantic specification: in the actor/actress class, the grammatically feminine form is specified for conceptual gender, while the unaffixed form is unspecified for conceptual gender, exemplifying the classic markedness asymmetry (Jakobson 1932); in the prince/princess class, despite the same morphological relation between the words, both the affixed and unaffixed form are semantically specified for conceptual gender (female and male, respectively). Bobaljik & Zocca and others (see Merchant 2014, Sudo & Spathas 2016, and Saab 2019) pursue accounts that code the difference between the classes in the linguistic representation of such nouns, incorporating (un)markedness into the explanation. By contrast, Haspelmath 2006 has suggested that differences in the relative frequency of the two forms in each pair may be the cause for the different behavior of the two classes. The frequency approach predicts that the size of the acceptability asymmetries that arise under the ellipsis test will correlate with the size of relative frequency ratio for each noun pair. In this article, we develop a formal experimental version of the Bobaljik & Zocca (2011) ellipsis test for gender asymmetries, and deploy it in two experiments: the first is a curated set of 16 noun pairs in English (by hypothesis 8 of each class), and the second is a test of 58 noun pairs forming a nearly exhaustive set of such pairs in English. We then use the freely available COCA corpus (Davies 2008) to test the prediction of the frequency approach. Our results suggest that the Haspelmath 2006 relative frequency hypothesis is not an empirically adequate competitor for the explanation of these asymmetries, as there is no evidence of a correlation between the size of the asymmetry effects in the acceptability judgment experiment and the size of the ratio of the relative frequency of the two forms in each pair for either the curated set of 16 noun pairs or the nearly exhaustive set of 58.","['gender asymmetries', 'ellipsis', 'experimental syntax', 'acceptability judgments', 'word frequency', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Infixes really are (underlyingly) prefixes/suffixes: Evidence from allomorphy on the fine timing of infixation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005581/current.pdf?_s=GfYcoQEBk7EPLN2h,"['Kalin, Laura']","While infixation and allomorphy have long been investigated as independent phenomena (see, e.g., Ultan 1975, Moravcsik 1977, Yu 2007 on infixation, and Carstairs 1987, Paster 2006, Veselinova 2006 on allomorphy), relatively little is known about what happens when infixation and allomorphy coincide. This paper presents the results of the first cross-linguistic study of allomorphy involving infixation, considering 49 case studies from 40 languages (13 language families). Allomorphy and infixation interact in consistent, systematic ways, suggestive of a universal architecture of the morphosyntax-phonology interface. More specifically, the findings support the type of serial architecture proposed by Distributed Morphology and related approaches (Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994, Embick 2010, Bye and Svenonius 2012), and run counter to fully parallel models (e.g., McCarthy and Prince 1993a,b, Prince and Smolensky 1993) and those that take infixation to be “direct” (e.g., Inkelas 1990, Yu 2007, Wolf 2008).

Mayan Agent Focus and the Ergative Extraction Constraint: Facts and Fictions Revisited,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004545/current.pdf?_s=qFAyB6e3hpcyEBGs,"['Coon, Jessica', 'Baier, Nico', 'Levin, Theodore']","Many languages of the Mayan family restrict the extraction of transitive (ergative) subjects for focus, wh-questions, and relativization (A'-extraction). We follow Aissen (2017b) in labelling this restriction the ergative extraction constraint (EEC). In this paper, we offer a unified account of the EEC within Mayan languages, as well as an analysis of the special construction known as Agent Focus (AF) used to circumvent it. Specifically, we propose that the EEC has a similar source across the subset of Mayan languages which exhibit it: intervention. The intervention problem is created when an object DP structurally intervenes between the A'-probe on C and the ergative subject. Evidence that intervention by the object is the source of the problem comes from a handful of exceptional contexts which permit transitive subjects to extract in languages which normally ban this extraction, and conversely, a context which exceptionally bans ergative extraction in a language which otherwise allows it. We argue that the problem with A'-extracting the ergative subject across the intervening object connects to the requirements of the A'-probe on C: the probe on C is bundled to search simultaneously for [A'] and [D] features. This relates the Mayan patterns to recent proposals for extraction patterns in Austronesian languages (e.g. Legate 2014; Aldridge 2017b) and elsewhere (van Urk 2015). Specifically, adapting the proposal of Coon and Keine (to appear), we argue that in configurations in which a DP object intervenes between the probe on C and an A'-subject, conflicting requirements on movement lead to a derivational crash. While we propose that the EEC has a uniform source across the family, we argue that AF constructions vary Mayan-internally in how they circumvent the EEC, accounting for the variation in behavior of AF across the family. This paper both contributes to our understanding of parametric variation internal to the Mayan family, as well as to the discussion of variation in A'-extraction asymmetries and syntactic ergativity cross-linguistically.","[""a'-extraction"", 'extraction restrictions', 'syntactic ergativity', 'agent focus', 'mayan', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Positively polar plurals: Theory and predictions,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005577/current.pdf?_s=CXHoP0rvunWo4RYC,"['Ahn, Dorothy', 'Saha, Ankana', 'Sauerland, Uli']","Several researchers have suggested that languages vary as to whether number marking on noun phrases is obligatory or optional (Arka & Dalrymple 2017; Biswas 2013; Bylinina & Podobryaev 2020; Corbett 2000; Kim 2005). We develop an implementation of this idea within a theory that assumes that the plural is a semantically vacuous, unmarked number (Sauerland, Anderssen & Yatsushiro 2005 and others). We then explore the semantic consequences of this proposal. One striking prediction of the proposal is that plural nouns should be ungrammatical in antitone environments in languages where number marking is optional, i.e. plurals should be positive polarity items in optional number languages. This prediction arises because the plural form is equivalent to the number neutral bare form in optional number languages. The Efficiency requirement of Meyer (2013) therefore predicts that plurals require local exhaustification in optional number languages since otherwise the bare form is more efficient. Because bare forms are impossible in obligatory number languages, plurals are not predicted to be positive polarity items in such languages. We conclude with an outlook on how to empirically verify the predictions of the theory we presented.","['number', 'exhaustification', 'presupposition', 'bangla', 'korean', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2020
Case-driven plural suppletion in Barguzin Buryat: *ABA versus case containment,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004504/current.pdf?_s=Ljqk5mHBU957VvtX,"['Davis, Colin']","This paper examines plural suppletion in Barguzin Buryat (Mongolic, Russia), which occurs only
in accusative and genitive noun phrases. The restricted distribution of this process, in particular its absence
in oblique case contexts, is significant for recent research on allomorphy and the feature structure of case
morphology. For much work in this vein, this form of suppletion would qualify as an “ABA” pattern, which is
predicted to be unattested. Here I argue that the suppletive plural morpheme in this language is a portmanteau
that expresses some of the features upon which oblique morphology also depends, thus preventing these
two forms from cooccurring. Hence this suppletive plural superficially has an ABA distribution due to
a paradigm gap stemming from a morphological conflict. Consequently, this pattern does not falsify the
morphological theories that ban ABA patterns under normal circumstances, but rather reveals a principled
exception to them. This investigation also reveals new evidence that case features have an implicational
containment relationship, and that syntactic structures can sometimes fail to be uttered.","['case', 'suppletion', 'aba', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

The corpus analysis is complemented by an unsuccessful attempt to train neural networks and by a pilot experiment asking native speakers to indicate their preferred linking strategy. In addition to existing nouns, the experimental stimuli included nonce words, also ending in schwa. While neither the corpus study nor the experiment offer a clear picture, the results nevertheless provide interesting insights into the intricacies of German compounding. Overall, we find a predominance of the paradigmatic linking element -n for feminine and masculine nouns. At the same time, the results for nonce words show that -n is not a default strategy.

Learned natural language patterns are expected to be most like the patterns in these classes, an expectation supported by previous typological and linguistic research in phonology. A second result is that the learning algorithms presented here are completely agnostic to choice of linguistic representation. In the case of the Subregular classes, the results fall out from traditional model-theoretic treatments of words and strings. The same learning algorithms, however, can be applied to model-theoretic treatments of other linguistic representations such as syntactic trees or autosegmental graphs, which opens a useful direction for future research.","['model theory', 'subregularity', 'grammatical inference', 'formal language theory', 'phonology', 'learning complexity', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2020

In this paper we examine the use of loshn koydesh elements among 26 native speakers of contemporary Hasidic Yiddish consisting of two subgroups a) 10 Israeli Hasidic Yiddish speakers, for whom Modern Hebrew is a majority co-territorial language, and b) 12 New York Hasidic Yiddish speakers alongside a small group of 4 London Hasidic Yiddish speakers, for whom English is a majority co-territorial language. Participants were given a written questionnaire with tasks examining three issues: 1) the gender of Hebrew/Aramaic nouns; 2) periphrastic verbs with a Hebrew/Aramaic element; and 3) adjectives derived from the loshn koydesh element of periphrastics. The paper has two aims, namely a) to ascertain whether contact with Modern Hebrew and English has resulted in differences in these speakers’ use of the loshn koydesh element of Yiddish, and b) whether there are differences between male and female speakers. Our findings show that there are marked differences on both the geographical and gender axes, many of which are consistent with the speakers' varied exposure to Modern Hebrew, English, and loshn koydesh. We also found that the loshn koydesh component has developed since the pre-War stage of the language and that some of these grammatical changes seem to effect contemporary Hasidic Yiddish usage in all locations and for both genders.

Second, I report the results of an elicited production task on Icelandic-speaking children (N = 26, ages 2;6-6;3 years) and adults (N = 18) that puts these predictions to test.

Passivierte Verbalkomplexe - passivized verbal clusters,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005050/current.pdf?_s=l9uQAWsTGfXF3mw3,"['Haider, Hubert']","Passive is customarily defined with reference to a verb and relational changes in the syntactic realization of its argument structure. However, this is too narrow a perspective. Passive may be applied not only to single verbs but also to verbal clusters. In this case, the passivized verb is the top-most verb in the cluster but the donor verb of the passive subject is a dependent one. The basic grammatical mechanism remains the same, but the argument structure it operates on in different. In the case of verbal clusters, the argument structure of the cluster is the aggregate of the argument structures of the verbs in the cluster. 

Four such cases are analysed, namely the passive of Ecm-constructions (a.k.a. AcI) headed by ""lassen"" (let) or by a perception verb, the passivization of passive, namely the additional passivization of German get-passives, and the passive of German clause-union infinitivals, a.k.a. long-distance passive.
In all these four cases, and in the case of simple verbs, the grammatical means of achieving the passive effect are identical, namely a combination of a participial form with a (semi)-auxiliary. The participle blocks the argument that surfaces as subject in the active construction. In verbal clusters, passive operates on the aggregated argument structure of the cluster, whose existence is independently motivated and necessary for the management of the aggregated argument structure of the clustered verbs. Passive applies to this argument structure in the same manner as it applies to the argument structure of a simple verb.

Fifty-five morphological features were extracted across 201 survey points, and the data subjected to a variety of analyses, including cluster analysis, regression, and correlation analysis. We establish that the Gaelic noun system shows robust diatopic (i. e. geographical) variation; this challenges previous assertions in the literature, which describe Gaelic morphosyntax as geographically uniform. In addition, we argue that our dialectometric results provide an insight into the grammatical structure of the language that is not easily achievable through the analysis of individual varieties. In particular, we argue that the results highlight a dissociation between morphological categories such as case and gender and their morphophonological exponents, which are particularly complex in Scottish Gaelic.

Until now, the prevalent view has been that their evolution follows one of the two diachronic paths: either they stop co- occurring with determiners (French, Spanish) or they start requiring their presence (European Portuguese). Contrary to the common analysis which associates the first case with a transition from a modifier to a determiner semantics of possessives and the second with a retention of a modifier semantics (e.g. Alexiadou 2004), we propose that the only change affecting all Romance languages is the passage from NP to DP grammar, while the semantics of possessives stays unchanged. We argue that the only point of evolutionary divergence is which of the two pre-existing possessive paradigms language retains. Using novel quantitative corpus data, we show for the first time that French, Spanish, and Portuguese undergo exactly the same diachronic evolution: the frequency of determiners goes monotonously up with one possessive paradigm (long forms) and goes up and then down with the other (short forms). The paper contributes to our understanding of evolutionary divergence and convergence, the nature of language change, and the morphosyntax and semantics of possessive DPs by adducing empirical evidence from three novel cases of failed change.","['adnominal possessives', 'language change', 'failed change', 'dp structure', 'dp semantics', 'romance languages', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

By providing an analysis of the complex meanings of lexical items as attested by Native Black American informants and comparing these lexical items with 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century texts of the Fulfulde/Pulaar language – with a particular focus on the source language’s complex system of radicals/root-stems and affixes – I will demonstrate that there is, in fact, a prodigious body of veritable Fulfulde-/Pulaar-derived words and phrases existing in the language of the Native Black American population of the United States mainland that negates the myth of African lexical scarcity in the language of Native Black Americans and connotes cultural continuity and cultural resistance.","['jive', 'africanisms', 'fulfulde', 'pulaar', 'pular', 'creole', 'native black american language', 'black american', 'aave', 'aav', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2020
The VO-OV split of Germanic languages – a T3 & V2 production,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005508/current.pdf?_s=uyWL4PjuxU0w3wNb,"['Haider, Hubert']","The sizeable Indo-European language families are syntactically homogenous, except for the Germanic family. Germanic is the only Indo-European language family that has split into an OV group (continental West Germanic) and a VO-group (English, North-Germanic). The predecessor languages of the modern Indo-European languages are neither OV nor VO, but representative of a third type (T3), as will be argued.  A single Germanic language, namely Yiddish, has preserved (or regained) its type III quality (amidst T3 Slavic languages). 
What is it that has triggered or facilitated the Germanic split? The answer involves a second ‘exceptional’ trait of Germanic. Germanic is the only Indo-European language family that has developed and maintained the V2 property, with a single language ‘left behind’, namely English. The grammaticalization of the V2 property has facilitated the change and triggered the transition from T3 to OV and VO, respectively. It is a change from an underspecified to a specified directionality of complement selection by the head of the phrase. OV and VO are the immediate results and the equally likely outcome of fixing the unspecified directionality for identification between verbal head and its dependents in changing a T3 proto-grammar.","['diachronic syntax', 'syntactic change', 'word order change', 'morphology', 'north germanic', 'west  germanic', 'slavic', 'romance', 'yiddish', 'old english', 'v2', 'typology', 'v-movement']",2020
Prosody as syntactic evidence: The view from Mayan,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005199/current.pdf?_s=nNRcq-pmoiWq5put,"['Royer, Justin']","A subset of Mayan languages feature “prosodic allomorphy”, a phenomenon involving morphological alternations at certain prosodic boundaries. In previous work, Henderson (2012) proposes that prosodic allomorphs in K’iche’ provide evidence for non-isomorphisms in the correspondence between syntax and prosody. In this paper, I argue against this view by building on a related extraposition analysis in Aissen 1992. I contribute novel data from prosodic allomorphy from two Mayan languages, Chuj and K’iche’, and show that upon further inspection, there is strong evidence for a syntactic analysis different from the one assumed in Henderson 2012. The new syntax leads to several predictions that are borne out, and crucially, does not force us to mismatches, allowing us to maintain a one-to-one correspondence between syntax and prosody. By taking apparent instances of mismatches as evidence that the syntactic analysis must be revisited, the proposal thus aligns with work such as Steedman 1991, Wagner 2005, 2010, and Hirsch and Wagner 2015. In the last section of the paper, I discuss how the proposal could be restated within phase theoretic approaches to the interface between syntax and phonology, concluding that Mayan prosodic allomorphy poses an interesting challenge for such accounts.","['prosody', 'syntax-phonology', 'mayan', 'extraposition', 'phases', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2020

For these researchers, Voice, together with two flavors of applicative heads, enable a wide range of phrases to be promoted to the phase edge of VoiceP and check structural case with T, giving rise to a cross-linguistically rare four-way voice system (e.g. Maclachlan 1996; Aldridge 2004, 2012, 2017; see also Rackowski 2002 and Rackowski & Richards 2005 for a similar approach). In this view, Austronesian-type voice is essentially similar to the active/passive alternation, with Voice being the core semi-functional head behind both types of systems.

In this paper, we argue instead that Austronesian-type voice is fundamentally different from Kratzerian Voice. Support for this claim comes from new data from Puyuma, an understudied Western Austronesian language that displays both an Austronesian-type four-way voice distinction and a two-way voice contrast akin to the Indo-European-style active/passive alternation. We show that these two voice types can co-occur in a single language because each is hosted in a distinct functional projection (the latter within VoiceP; the former in the C domain).

Instead, the claim I defend here is that the onus of the linearization process falls on the prosody in Arabic, the central assumption being that the morphosyntactic structure, the output of the syntactic derivation, is the input to OT morphophonological constraints. These constraints are responsible for the linearization of the terminal nodes of the syntactic derivation.

We find that while the amount of second language speakers accounts for differences in the range and number of inflectional categories (degrees of synthesis), it does not affect the way in which morphological constituents are bound together, reflecting fortification through a mix of diachronically stable and universally preferred patterns.

Tagalog voice as four bundles of Agree relations: Insights from binding,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005425/current.pdf?_s=byOKGH_n7GB2oiqW,"['Chen, Victoria']","A central question in Austronesian syntax concerns a typologically peculiar four-way voice system found in Tagalog and similar languages, where a change in verbal morphology correlates with a distinct argument-marking pattern and A-bar extraction restrictions.

In this paper, I demonstrate instead that voice alternation in Tagalog has no correlation with argument structure alternation, but indexes a change in topic selection. Support for this claim comes from novel binding evidence from Tagalog’s three-place constructions, which shows that Tagalog’s four-way voice morphology is best analyzed as the spell-out of four different bundles of abstract Agree relations that target the topic (i.e. pivot-marked phrase) of a clause, rather than case agreement or valency-indicating morphology hosted within VoiceP.

Formally, what it means to represent or process a word as decomposed or not turns out to be quite complex. One of the basic lines of division in the field classifies approaches according to whether they decompose all “complex” words (“Full Decomposition”), or none (“Full Listing”), or some but not all, according to some criterion (typical of “Dual-Route” models). However, if we are correct, there are at least three senses in which an approach might be said to be decompositional or not, with the result that ongoing discussions of what appears to be a single large issue might not always be addressing the same distinction. Put slightly differently, there is no single question of decomposition. Instead, there are independent but related questions that define current research.

Person-based Prominence in Ojibwe,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005362/current.pdf?_s=NzvJwn2ektn_dsLC,"['Hammerly, Christopher']","This dissertation develops a formal and psycholinguistic theory of person-based prominence effects, the finding that certain categories of person such as ""first"" and ""second"" (the ""local"" persons) are privileged by the grammar. The thesis takes on three questions: (i) What are the possible categories related to person? (ii) What are the possible prominence relationships between these categories? And (iii) how is prominence information used to parse and interpret linguistic input in real time?

The empirical through-line is understanding obviation — a “spotlighting” system, found most prominently in the Algonquian family of languages, that splits the (animate) third persons into two categories: proximate, the person who is in the spotlight, and obviative, the persons who are introduced into the discourse, but are not in the spotlight. I provide a semantics for the feature [proximate], and detail a lattice-based theory of feature composition to derive the categories related to obviation in Border Lakes Ojibwe and beyond. This leads to insights about the syntactic and semantic relationships between person, animacy-based noun classification, number, and obviation.

The novel contribution to the theory of person-based prominence effects is to decompose person features into sets of primitives. This proposal allows the stipulated entailment relationships between categories and features, as encoded in prominence hierarchies and feature geometries, to be derived from the first principles of set theory. I further motivate the account by showing that it has increased empirical coverage, and apply it to capture patterns of agreement and word order in Border Lakes Ojibwe.

Finally, I present a psycholinguistic study on how obviation is used to process filler-gap dependencies in Border Lakes Ojibwe. I show that obviation, and by extension, prominence information more generally, is used immediately to predictively encode movement chains, prior to bottom-up information from voice marking about the argument structure of the clause. I argue for a modular and syntax-first model of parsing, revising the Active Filler Strategy to be guided by pressures to minimize syntactic distance and maximize the expected well-formedness of each link in the chain. These pressures compete, accounting for effects of prediction, integration, and reanalysis in long-distance dependency formation.

Computational locality of cyclic phonology in Armenian,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005204/current.pdf?_s=5bv_QG9-zYqUu3CK,"['Dolatian, Hossep']","The title of this dissertation indicates its goal: to determine the computational aspects of cyclic phonology as it operates in Armenian. This goal is divided into two subgoals based on empirical and computational questions. 

On the empirical side, I show that Armenian requires a model of the morphology-phonology interface which is interactionist and cyclic, i.e., that morphological structure, prosodic structure, and phonological rules cyclically interact to create new words. Evidence for this nuanced organization comes from the stratal phonology of Armenian (cf. Lexical Phonology and Stratal OT: Kiparsky 1982; Bermúdez-Otero 2018). There are phonological processes which apply differently before derivational morphology than in inflectional morphology. The main process that I examine is destressed high vowel reduction. This and other processes indicate not only different strata or levels, but also show signs of unbounded cyclicity and sensitivity to sublexical prosodic constituents, i.e., the Prosodic Stem (Downing 1999). These processes are active in both simplex and compound words. Within compounds, the interaction of all these factors creates bracketing paradoxes. I solve these paradoxes using a mixture of cyclic prosodic phonology and Head-Operations (Hoeksema 1988). I show that counter-cyclic approaches to bracketing paradoxes, like Morphological Merger or Rebracketing (Marantz 1988), are inadequate because they contradict the rest of Armenian phonology. 

There are many different incarnations of cyclic theories of phonology but there are little to no computational analyses of them. I develop an extensive computational formalization for cyclic or interactionist phonology by using Monadic-Second Order (MSO) logic, specifically graph-to-graph logical transductions. Logic is a flexible tool that lets us create iconic formalizations which faithfully replicate phonological theory. I utilize logical transductions as a way to encode the derivational nature of phonology. The formalism is a generalization of the work from one-level Declarative Phonology (Bird 1995; Coleman 1998) to a two-level framework. By formalizing the morphology, prosody, and phonological rule domains, I uncover implicit factors within cyclic phonology. The ultimate takeaway is that I show that the bulk of the morphology-phonology interface requires local computation, not global computation. By being local, the computational nature of the morphology-phonology interface opens doors to understanding how we can provably learn morpho-phonological processes and how these processes relate to limitations on human cognition (cf. Heinz 2018).

Derivational morphology,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005429/current.pdf?_s=aNGzHifIz_VU7G76,"['Mcginnis, Martha', 'Wood, Jim']","In this paper, we outline some of the main ways that phenomena traditionally referred to as “derivation” have been treated in Distributed Morphology (DM), focusing on the general issue of how the characteristics of derivation emerge from the grammar. We begin in the first half of the paper by discussing the status of derivation, focusing on criteria that classically distinguish between derivation and inflection, on the one hand, and derivation and compounding, on the other. We also discuss the relevance of the distinction between “words” and “phrases” to widespread notions of what counts as derivational morphology. The thrust of this section is to explain why “derivation” is not a primitive notion in DM, and to give a first sense of how DM handles phenomena traditionally treated as derivational. In the second half of the paper, we turn to a structural distinction that does fall out from the architecture of grammar adopted in most work within DM—specifically, the distinction between inner and outer affixation. We focus primarily on category-changing morphology and different proposals for what, structurally, counts as “inner” vs. “outer”, and what empirical effects this distinction corresponds to. We also discuss some ways in which “category change” is not necessarily a structurally unified notion. Finally, we turn to various (mostly prepositional) prefixing phenomena and discuss how these may reflect the inner/outer distinction as well.

Number-based noun classification: The view from Kipsigis,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005444/current.pdf?_s=gBt8UJdyCRaHX7V_,"['Kouneli, Maria']","Nilo-Saharan languages are well-known for their complicated system of nominal number marking, which features a variety of singulative and plural affixes (Dimmendaal 2000). Even though these systems have received some attention in the typological literature, there has been limited theoretical work on their implications for the morphosyntax of number cross-linguistically. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap, by providing an analysis of nominal number morphology in Kipsigis (Nilotic, Kenya), based on data from original fieldwork. First, I show that singulatives in Kipsigis are true allomorphs of singular number, unlike singulatives with a classifier function in languages like Ojibwe (Mathieu 2012). The descriptive term ‘singulative’ is therefore misleading, as it corresponds to two very different types of morphemes. Second, I claim that the tripartite system of number marking of Kipsigis and other Nilo-Saharan languages is due to the classification of nouns into morphosyntactic classes defined by the presence of inherent number features on little n; the interaction of these features with interpretable number features on the functional projection Num (Ritter 1991 a.o.) in the post-syntactic component gives rise to the exponence pattern that we observe. Finally, my analysis corroborates the existence of noun classification based on number, which has only been argued for Kiowa-Tanoan before (Harbour 2007). The existence of three number classes in Kipsigis can only be explained by reference to bivalent number features; number- based noun classification systems thus strongly support the view that number features are bivalent and not privative, which is also argued by Harbour (2007, 2011) for Kiowa.","['kipsigis', 'number', 'noun classification', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Person features and shiftiness,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005433/current.pdf?_s=iwfGZ_vd12ugfELa,"['Deal, Amy Rose']","What are the basic syntactic pieces underlying person systems, and how does the grammar combine and manipulate these pieces? Most discussion of these questions has taken place against a relatively standard backdrop of assumptions concerning the possible meanings of the semantic primitives to which syntactic pieces or features correspond. First person, for instance, refers to the individual who is speaking; second person refers to the individual who is being addressed. This paper explores what can be learned about the syntactic and semantic representation of person from cases where this baseline behavior fails to hold. Three case studies are presented. The first investigates the relationship between second person features and first person features, focusing in particular on cases where first person shifts but second person does not. I show that (perhaps surprisingly) these facts are compatible both with a theory with dedicated second person features and with a theory positing only speaker and participant features. The second case study explores the nature of locative expressions, and in particular the proposal from Harbour 2016 that words such as ""here"" have person features at their core. I argue against this proposal based on cases where first person shifts but locatives do not. Lastly, the third case study investigates the nature of person inflection in languages such as Amharic, which contain indexiphors (Deal 2018). I argue that ""first person inflection"" in this language reflects a syncretism between two separate types of features, properly indexical first person features (which reference the author of the context) and indexiphoric author features (which reference the author of the index of interpretation). Syncretism of this type suggests that standard first person features are not themselves primitive, but rather consist at the ""subatomic'' level of a specification of the author function and a specification of the formal object (the context) to which this function applies.","['first person', 'second person', 'locative', 'indexical', 'indexical shift', 'syncretism', 'atom', 'primitive', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Ellipsis: its way from syntax to morphology,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004522/current.pdf?_s=WiKmTWnB4pQLTDbL,"['Saab, Andrés']","This chapter focuses on the mechanics of ellipsis at the syntax –morphology interface. It is shown that two of the adduced arguments against syntactic identity, namely, the distribution of traces within E-sites and certain types of inflectional mismatches, are illusory once phrasal ellipsis is explicitly defined as an operation of narrow syntax. On this theory, ellipsis bleeds vocabulary insertion at PF by deleting the variables that triggers late insertion of phonological material at PF. Phrasal copies and E-sites are both subject to ellipsis in this sense. The particular way in which these two silent objects interact explains why phrasal traces are irrelevant when it comes to calculating identity within a given E-site. This analysis not only answers well-known objections against syntactic identity but is also superior to competing semantic analyses in nontrivial ways. As for heads, it is proposed that they are subject to ellipsis at PF under identity and morphological locality. Among other important asymmetries between head and phrasal copies, this derives the lexical identity requirement in certain V-stranding VP-ellipsis languages (Goldberg 2005), even assuming syntactic head movement through adjunction. Finally, certain inflectional mismatches are derived by the syntactic nature of phrasal ellipsis and the timing of morphological operations. The broad picture is a model for the timing of ellipsis that covers not only surface anaphora, but other types of grammatical silences, as well.

The voice system of Amharic,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005528/current.pdf?_s=lYsusLPDrYkptvcG,"['Workneh, Desalegn']","This dissertation examines the voice system of Amharic. I have studied the voice features including the anticausative and a pair of causative functional items focusing on their selection, interpretation and syntactic projection. The voice items display some interesting properties that made them worth an in­depth investigation. First, the single anticausative morpheme is associated with multiple constructions such as the passive, reciprocal, reflexive, middle and the like. This raises the foundational theoretical problem on the relation between form and meaning. Furthermore, the causative items display quite striking contrasts with the anticausative in selection. The direct causative item filters verb classes. The indirect causative does a similar filtering, but mostly on the types of external arguments. The anticausative, on the other hand, imposes little selection restriction on the verb and argument types. How the selection patterns are correlated with the interpretation and with the syntactic position of the voice items is the main concern of this study. In this dissertation, I have proposed that all the crucial properties of the voice items, including the observed distinctions in selection, projection and interpretation, can be explained by understanding the voice items two types–those that belong to both the syntactic and semantic domains, and those belong to the syntax only. The natural consequence of this understanding is that the syntax specific features could impose selection only within the syntactic component. They freely combine with all semantic classes of verbs. The interface features, on the other hand, impose selection both on the syntactic derivation as well as the semantic composition. The causative items in Amharic are interface features—they merge with their semantic interpretations, as their syntactic categories. Because of this, they impose selection restrictions on the items they merge with not only in their syntactic properties but also on their semantic attributes. The anticausative, on the other hand, is proposed to be a purely syntactic feature. That means, its distribution is fully determined by its syntactic category. Furthermore, I will argue that multiple decausative constructions associated with the anticausative morpheme such as the passive, reciprocal, reflexive, and middle, etc., are not coded into the morpheme itself.

Not only size matters: limits to the Law of Three Consonants in French phonology,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005465/current.pdf?_s=qzhM4NmK8auxpS_b,"['Storme, Benjamin']","Grammont’s Law of Three Consonants (LTC) states that French schwa is obligatorily pronounced in any CC_C sequence to avoid three-consonant clusters. Although schwa presence has been shown to be sensitive not only to cluster size but also to the nature of consonants in post-lexical phonology, the LTC is still considered as accurate to describe schwa-zero alternations in lexical phonology. The paper uses judgment data from French speakers in France and Switzerland to compare the behavior of schwa in derived words (lexical phonology) and inflected words (post-lexical phonology). The results show that schwa-zero alternations are conditioned not only by cluster size but also by cluster type in lexical phonology. Moreover, the same phonotactic asymmetries among consonant clusters are found in lexical and post-lexical phonologies. The data therefore support a weaker version of the lexical-phonology hypothesis than what is usually assumed for French. Lexical and post-lexical phonologies do not require different phonotactic constraints but only different weights for the same constraints.","['phonology', 'morphology', 'french', 'schwa', 'inflection/derivation', 'judgment data', 'probabilistic constraint-based grammars', 'bayesian statistics', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2020
Local and non-local  dependency learning and emergence of rule-like representations in speech data by Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005470/current.pdf?_s=e-ougBH0IAt1t241,"['Begus, Gasper']","This paper argues that training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on local and non-local dependencies in speech data offers insights into how deep neural networks discretize continuous data and how symbolic-like rule-based morphophonological processes emerge in a deep convolutional architecture. Acquisition of speech has recently been modeled as a dependency between latent space and data generated by GANs in Beguš (2020c), who models learning of a simple local allophonic distribution. We extend this approach to test learning of local and non-local phonological processes that include approximations of morphological processes. We further parallel outputs of the model to results of a behavioral experiment where human subjects are trained on the data used for training the GAN network. Four main conclusions emerge: (i) the networks provide useful information for computational models of language acquisition even if trained on a comparatively small dataset of an artificial grammar learning experiment; (ii) local processes are easier to learn than non-local processes, which matches both behavioral data in human subjects and typology in the world’s languages. This paper also proposes (iii) how we can actively observe the network’s progress in learning and explore the effect of training steps on learning representations by keeping latent space constant across different training steps. Finally, this paper shows that (iv) the network learns to encode the presence of a prefix with a single latent variable; by interpolating this variable, we can actively observe the operation of a non-local phonological process. The proposed technique for retrieving learning representations has general implications for our understanding of how GANs discretize continuous speech data and suggests that rule-like generalizations in the training data are represented as an interaction between variables in the network’s latent space.","['neural networks', 'behavioral experiments', 'machine learning', 'learning biases', 'speech', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2020
Phasehood as defective intervention: Possessor extraction and selective DP islandhood in West Circassian,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005469/current.pdf?_s=fyaWA5hgKcQvQzmD,"['Ershova, Ksenia']","This paper presents evidence from West Circassian for an agree-based approach to the islandhood of nominal arguments. In West Circassian, ergative and applied arguments are islands for subextraction, while the absolutive argument is not. Counter to previous approaches, the observed asymmetry does not correlate with movement, phi-agreement, position of merge, or structural complexity. Furthermore, these islandhood effects are absent in long-distance wh-movement and parasitic gap configurations. I argue that these patterns arise as a result of phase edges being opaque for subextraction and phases serving as interveners for agree. The contrast between matrix and embedded contexts is reduced to the difference in the featural content of the probe which drives the wh-movement – in embedded contexts this probe successfully agrees with the lower phase heads, rendering them non-interveners for further syntactic operations. The proposed analysis informs our understanding of phasehood, wh-movement, and islandhood effects cross-linguistically.

Words within Words: The Internal Syntax of Verbs,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005431/current.pdf?_s=ZlV3mfQpR-pt2lG0,"['Fenger, Paula']","This dissertation explores the complex interactions between syntax and the form-related modules of grammar: morphology, and phonology. In particular, I consider how syntactic elements are mapped to different units in these modules, focusing primarily on what we intuitively label as words. The empirical domain is verb and auxiliary patterns, as this particular domain has rich variation in whether tense, mood, aspect and valency changing morphology is expressed in single or multi-word constructions. On the surface the choice for an inflectional category being expressed as auxiliary or affix seems arbitrary. In this dissertation, however, I argue that it is not as arbitrary as it may appear. I explore how the expression of features in one or more words can differ systematically cross-linguistically and propose that syntactic word-formation is sensitive to syntactic domains (phases). In order to do so, I approach this problem from various angles. Chapter 2 focuses on an in-depth investigation of two head-final languages (Japanese and Turkish) and mismatches between syntactic and phonological word-hood tests. I show that these mismatches follow from particular word building processes and their interaction with syntactic domains. Hence these mismatches are not arbitrary. Chapter 3 explores the status of word building operations, and the idea that timing differences in the derivation lead to variation in auxiliary patterns. I provide evidence that auxiliary patterns in a language pattern with other phenomena that align with the timing of word building, such as matching constraints in ellipsis. Chapter 4 focuses on correlations between domains in word building and domains in the syntax, i.e., correlations between auxiliaries and phases. Finally, chapter 5 explores which inflectional features are expressed in single or multi-word expression in a cross-linguistic sample of 33 languages from 18 families. I show that inflectional categories inside the first phase do not participate in periphrasis.  I show that there is more uniformity than initial appearances suggest in the expression of features as single words or periphrastic constructions, and that there may be universal aspects to the analysis. Furthermore, the apparent mismatches between phonological and syntactic tests for word-hood are in fact regular consequences of the relevant processes and their timing pointing to the need for a more integrated approach to cross-modular research.","['verbal inflection', 'words', 'periphrasis-synthesis', 'phases', '(head) movement', 'typology', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2020

It has sometimes been suggested that the Boasian imperative (“each language should be described in its own terms”) leads to uninsightful analyses, and that language description should instead be “typologically informed”. But the Boasian imperative is not at all incompatible with an intimate connection between description and comparison: Comparative (or typological) knowledge is highly valuable both for making our descriptions transparent and comprehensible, and for helping describers to ask a wide range of questions that would not have occurred to them otherwise. Since we do not know whether any of the building blocks of languages are innate and universal for this reason, we cannot rely on general frameworks (of the generative type) for our descriptions, but we can use typological questionnaires and other kinds of comparative information as a scaffold. Such scaffolds are not theoretical components of the description, but are important methodological tools.","['comparative grammar', 'linguistic analysis', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2020
Levels of Ontology and Natural Language: the Case of the Ontology of Parts and Wholes,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005094/current.pdf?_s=SOQcENhKxDK9yMyu,"['Moltmann, Friederike']","Two levels of ontology are commonly distinguished in philosophy: the ontology of ordinary objects and the ontology of what there really or fundamentally is. This papers argues that natural language reflects not only the ontology of ordinary objects, but also a language-driven ontology, which is involved in the mass-count distinction and part-structure-sensitive semantic selection (as well as perhaps the light ontology of pleonastic entities in the sense of Schiffer). The language-driven ontology does not constitute another level of representation, but is taken to be a (selective) ontology of the real, given a plenitudinous or maximalist conception of reality, which has been advocated by a number of philosophers. The language-driven ontology aligns closely with the functional part of grammar and a commitment to it is mandatory with the use of language. This gives rise to a novel view according to which part of ontology (ontology of the real) should be considered part of universal grammar on a broadened understanding.

In this paper, I expand upon Her’s (2009) original proposal arguing that both long and short passives involve A’-movement and thus should have a unified account  and I present new evidence showing that in both passives, the complement to bei must at least be as large as Asp, contra Bruening and Tran’s (2015) suggestion that it can only be as large as (passive) Voice (Kratzer 1996). My account requires that both constructions have VoicePass, also contra Bruening and Tran (2015), which accounts for a range of novel data: both long and short bei-passives can license a unique class of verbal compounds that are also grammatical in the gei (‘give’), jiao (‘ask’) and rang (‘allow’) passives, and in passives embedded in ba-constructions, but importantly are ungrammatical in active constructions, which have VoiceAct.","['mandarin', 'generative grammar', 'voice morphology', 'passive constructions', 'bei-passives', 'a-movement', ""a'-movement"", 'argument structure', 'theta roles', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Argument Structure and Argument-marking in Choctaw,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005364/current.pdf?_s=-9FKvt070wQFUJFV,"['Tyler, Matthew']","This thesis examines argument structure - the linking relations between verbs and their arguments - in Choctaw, a Muskogean language spoken in Mississippi and Oklahoma. My focus is on three morphological reflexes of argument structure, which constitute the argument-marking systems of the title. Firstly, the verb may host various morphological markers of voice, which often carry labels like ‘transitive’ or ‘causative’. Secondly, the verb may host clitics which index (or ‘double’) certain arguments. Thirdly, overt arguments may carry case-markers. Following recent work in Minimalism and Distributed Morphology, I argue that each of these morphological systems is ‘read off’ a syntactic structure, which encodes verbal argument structure through a root and an arrangement of functional heads (v, Voice, Appl). This syntactic structure must make use of, at least, trivalent specifier requirements, in the sense of Kastner (2020), and a licensing relation. And in the mappings from syntactic structure to morphological and semantic output, there must be a high degree of contextual conditioning, in the sense of Wood and Marantz (2017). Of particular relevance to the syntax-morphology interface, I argue that case-assignment is morphological, and subject to contextual conditioning in the same way that morphological exponence is.","['choctaw', 'syntax', 'morphology', 'argument structure', 'case', 'agreement', 'syntax']",2020

Templates can induce alternations in argument structure (e.g. causativization) and diathesis (e.g. passivization)---characteristics typically associated with v and Voice.

Switch reference as index agreement,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004945/current.pdf?_s=eWsTBsnjw56nTPUF,"['Arregi, Karlos', 'Hanink, Emily']","The grammatical notion of switch reference refers to morphological markers that track whether the subjects of two related clauses are coreferent (Jacobsen 1967). We argue in this paper for a treatment of switch reference as index agreement, based on the behavior of switch reference in Washo (Hokan/isolate; USA). We propose that switch reference marking arises as the result of multiple agreement between C in an embedded clause and the referential index values of the subject in that embedded clause and the subject in its superordinate clause. The morphemes representing both different and same subject marking are then the exponence of the presence or absence, respectively, of conflict in the featural make up of C. We argue that, unlike alternatives based on coordination, control, or binding, an agreement-based account explains several core properties of the phenomenon in Washo, including the distribution and internal structure of clauses marked for switch reference, as well as the exponence of switch reference in cases of reference overlap. More generally, switch reference in Washo provides evidence that Agree can be bidirectional (downward and upward), as well as for the existence of referential indices as true syntactic objects that participate in syntactic operations.","['switch reference', 'agreement', 'upward agree', 'referential indices', 'washo', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

An alternative view which presupposes a modular postsyntax assigns operational autonomy to rules responsible for feature splitting, displacement, and exponence. I argue that the latter approach is empirically superior on the basis of a novel set of allomorphic alternations from Semitic which demonstrate that Fission and displacement feed, and hence cannot be equated with, Vocabulary Insertion. The result is that the inventory of postsyntactic operations must include at least the following three operations: Fission, Metathesis, and Vocabulary Insertion.","['morphology', 'fission', 'discontinuous agreement', 'allomorphy', 'displacement', 'semitic', 'morphology']",2020

Put in different terms, we argue that, to license VP ellipsis, T must enter into a Spec-Head agreement relationship with the phrase in its specifier, and must be in a c-command relationship with a local v head that has a [tense] value. We therefore revive and extend the “Spec-Head agreement” analyses first entertained by Saito & Murasugi (1990) and Lobeck (1995). Novel support for this analysis comes from the behaviour of VP ellipsis in copular clauses in which the occupant of SpecTP is not a standard referential DP, but an expletive or predicate (proform). We demonstrate that, in these “Unusual Subject” configurations, VP ellipsis is judged as acceptable only if T and the unusual subject engage in a Spec-Head agreement relationship. Because this correlation is also attested in Unusual Subject raising configurations and in Unusual Subject configurations in which British English do ellipsis occurs, we also provide new support for the proposal that matrix T licenses VP ellipsis in to-infinitive complement clauses (Zagona 1988, Lobeck 1995) and for the idea that British English do ellipsis is no different from standard VP ellipsis from a syntactic perspective (Thoms & Sailor 2018, contra Aelbrecht 2010, Baltin 2012). With respect to the timing of ellipsis, we provide decisive evidence against “derivational-timing” approaches to VP/do ellipsis in English.","['vp ellipsis', 'spec-head agreement', ""british english 'do' ellipsis"", 'predicate inversion', 'subject extraction', 'syntax-prosody mapping', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2020

While Baker uses morphological ordering to demonstrate the inseparability of syntax and morphology, he does not dwell on the formal means by Mirror Principle-compliance is enacted in the grammar, tacitly assuming a cyclic morphological concatenation-based system.

This paper develops a new framework for morpheme ordering, the Mirror Alignment Principle (MAP), which derives the Mirror Principle while avoiding some of the
shortcomings of cyclic morphological concatenation. The MAP is a morphology/phonology-interface algorithm that takes morphosyntactic c-command relations and
dynamically translates them into a ranking of Alignment constraints (McCarthy and Prince 1993) in CON in the phonological component. All possible morpheme orders are generated by GEN, and the optimal surface order is selected by EVAL. Even though morpheme order is computed in the phonology, the driving force behind this order is the syntax/morphology. This link between grammatical components generates Mirror Principle-compliant morpheme orders.

This paper focuses on two case studies. First, it will show how the MAP is consistent with the complex interaction between Mirror Principle-satisfaction and the
“CARP template” in Bantu (Hyman 2003). Second, it will show that the MAP can explain ordering alternations within Arabic’s nonconcatenative verbal system. This
will demonstrate that Mirror Principle-behavior can indeed be identified even in nonconcatenative morphology. Lastly, the paper situates the MAP proposal within the broader debates surrounding the phonology-morphology interface, with special attention to infixation.","['mirror principle', 'alignment', 'morpheme ordering', 'bantu carp template', 'arabic nonconcatenative morphology', 'infixation', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2020
On How Morphology Spreads,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005538/current.pdf?_s=zu1SIqsiVSLcbBaK,"['Gardani, Francesco']","The term ‘borrowing’, especially when applied to bound morphology, often describes phenomena that, while appearing to be identical, are, in reality, not coextensive. By combining data and analyses from contact linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science, this study provides an explicit and principled treatment of different phenomena of morphological transfer, showing that a demarcation reflects psycholinguistic facts, which, if analyzed properly, allow us to gain useful insights into synchronic bilingual processing and diachronic language change. In particular, it is claimed that morphological borrowing occurs via cross-language structural priming and that speakers have the ability to relate to the internal structure of words (‘morphological relatability’), which can interfere with the inhibitory control mechanism that preempts access to the non-targeted language, and override it, thereby enabling morphological priming. A large body of evidence, ranging from experimental psycholinguistics to language change and first language acquisition, underpins this assumption. Relatable morphology is claimed to be a precondition for morphological transfer and borrowing to occur, and a Stratal Effect is hypothesized, which, applying to varying extent, gives rise to at least three distinct types of morphological transfer. Finally, the mainstream view according to which affix borrowing can be either direct or indirect is dismissed, and it is shown that affix borrowing always involves an indirect process including extrapolation of relatable formatives and their diffusion within the lexicon.","['inhibitory control', 'language change', 'language contact', 'morphological borrowing', 'priming', 'processing', 'morphology']",2020

Yet many get- passive properties remain poorly understood. We present an analysis of the get-passive centered on the proposal that it contains additional event structure (realized as get) relative to its be counterpart. We employ by-adjuncts to identify the event structures in passive types, and demonstrate that the behavior of this and other diagnostics support the conclusion that get- and be-passives differ systematically in ways that accord with our analysis. Further discussion considers the prominent proposal from previous studies that get-passives differ thematically from be-passives in (sometimes) assigning an Agent role to their surface subjects. We show that there is no evidence for such an analysis. Instead, intuitions about the interpretation of the get-passive surface subject arise from how an event’s Responsible Party is identified: contrasts between get and be on this dimension are a consequence of event structural differences between the two. The overall result is a unified analysis of the get-passive, one that has implications for the role of event structure in understanding the syntax and interpretation of arguments.","['get-passive', 'event structure', 'argument structure', 'voice alternations', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

Furthermore, we show that negation forms a complex unit with the highest verb of the clause and thus crucially differs from negative auxiliaries in other Finno-Ugric languages like Finnish and from other auxiliaries. We argue that the properties of negation are best modelled by means of postsyntactic Lowering (Embick and Noyer 2001). Next to the semantic vacuousness of the displacement, the main arguments for a postsyntactic perspective come from the internal constituency of the verb cluster, the possibility to interleave clitics inside the verb cluster only in the presence of negation, and cases where Lowering fails and a syntacto-semantically inert copula is inserted as a repair. We show that competing approaches to complex head formation based on narrow-syntactic head-movement, flexible spell-out in different positions or base-generation fail to capture the crucial properties of negative verb clusters. On a more general level, we thus provide evidence for the necessity of post-syntactic mechanisms for word formation and a serial architecture of the morphology-syntax interface.

Our study highlights voice “reversals”—i.e., cases in which the expected mismatch disappears and morphological and syntactic valency match. We determine that such reversals correlate with morphological locality, and cannot be derived by hierarchical factors.

I use Armenian as a case study to argue for the use of cyclic approaches to bracketing paradoxes over the more common counter-cyclic approaches. I analyze the bracketing paradox using cyclic Head-Operations (Hoeksema 1984) and Prosodic Phonology (Nespor and Vogel 1986), specifically the Prosodic Stem (Downing 1999a). I argue that the interaction between the bracketing paradox and the rest of compound phonology requires the use of stratal levels and cyclicity. I argue that counter-cyclic approaches like Morphological Merger (Marantz 1988) or Morphological Rebracketing (Sproat 1985) are inadequate because they make incorrect predictions about Armenian phonology.","['compound', 'bracketing paradox', 'head', 'cyclicity', 'armenian', 'morphological merger', 'head operation', 'prosodic stem', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2020

The term affix is sometimes thought to be involve phonological “fusion” of some kind, but I propose that it is best defined as a bound non-root that occurs on roots of different classes. A bound form (or non-autonomous form) is generally defined as a form that does not occur on its own, i.e. its definition makes no reference to phonology. As a term for a form that shows phonological interactions with its host, I propose the new term welded form. I discuss the ways in which these terms may (or may not) help us justify the syntax-morphology subdivision, and the ways in which these terms may perhaps be the basis for justifying speculative classifications such as the well-known isolating, agglutinative and flective types.","['affix', 'bound form', 'welded form', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2020

Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993) allows allomorphy to be conditioned in many components of the grammar: syntax, phonology, and the lexicon. In no small part, the specific pronunciation of morphemes depends on rules of Vocabulary Insertion--the subject of this review. We start with a general review of what allomorphy is, and how it has been classified analytically both in DM and in other theories of morphology and phonology. After sketching some analyses of simple cases of allomorphy, we build towards more complex examples, considering various issues they raise. One is whether, from a structural point of view, allomorphy is conditioned differently by inner vs. outer context. Another is how far away the conditioning environment can be from the affected morpheme. We also review various theory-internal debates within DM, including the role of linear adjacency, how competition for insertion is resolved, and whether this competition is a property of roots. We end with a discussion of broader questions about allomorphy as a phonological and a morphosyntactic phenomenon.","['allomorphy', 'vocabulary insertion', 'distributed morphology', 'lexicon', 'locality', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2020

For some of them, the existing evidence from the world’s languages and from corpus counts is already strong, while for others, I know of no counterevidence and I make readily testable claims.

Remarks on Oku’s generalization. Anti-agreement and subject ellipsis in Spanish and Japanese,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005317/current.pdf?_s=ZsDq6tBfymtA8ele,"['Saab, Andrés']","I focus on the so-called Oku’s generalization in order to show: (i) that a main division among at least two types of pro-drop languages is irreducible, i.e., radical vs. consistent pro-drop (pace Duguine 2013), and (ii) that the distinction can be understood in terms of two types of ellipsis, namely phrasal DP-ellipsis (Japanese) and head pronoun ellipsis (Spanish). Such a distinction follows from a general model for ellipsis within and across languages and does not have to be stipulated for the particular distribution of null subjects in Japanese and Spanish. Thus, the difference between radical and consistent pro-drop languages does not follow from the deep vs. surface anaphora distinction, but from the timing of ellipsis in each language. In addition, I conjecture that the lack of DP-ellipsis in Spanish, and consistent pro-drop languages in general, is due to the agreement-Case system. In this respect, my analysis is committed to the so-called anti-agreement hypothesis, according to which the availability of DP-ellipsis is connected to absence of morphological agreement. Finally, even when I dispense with the deep vs. surface distinction as a way of deriving Oku’s generalization, I claim that null NP anaphora, a type of deep anaphora, is syntactically active at least in radical and partial pro-drop languages (Barbosa 2019).

Reduplication: A New Distributed Morphology Approach,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005292/current.pdf?_s=l59IX54UdmlVdmuQ,"['Alqarni, Muteb']","The current paper aims to capture the properties of reduplication within the distributed morphology model (Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994; Embick and Noyer 2006; Siddiqi 2009; Embick 2010). Taking Standard Arabic (SA) as a representative, the article shows that SA, like many other languages, has both full and partial reduplication. Full reduplication repeats entire words or stems whereas partial reduplication doubles part of the stem. Rather than the available two analyses, i.e. the readjustment approach (Raimy 2000; Frampton 2009) and the affixation approach (Haugen 2008; Haugen and Harley 2010; Haugen 2011), the current paper provides a novel approach to the phenomenon of reduplication in the world languages. It argues that root consonants and vowels should be decomposed into non-phonetic distinctive features that undergo late insertion at PF. These non-phonetic distinctive features are supplied with sound items at PF in the same fashion that the terminal nodes with morphosyntactic features are fed with vocabulary items. This approach serves three purposes. It accounts for speech errors, captures the non-concatenative morphology in Semitic languages, and allows the reduplicant form to copy all the distinctive features of the roots, yielding instances of full reduplication. Instances of partial reduplication can be generated by root-sensitive impoverishment rules which target and delete some of the features of the stem or the reduplicant form.","['reduplication', 'standard arabic', 'distributed morphology', 'sound items', 'impoverishment rule', 'morphology']",2020
Bayesian and Random Forest Models of Morphosyntactic Variation:  Accusative vs. Dative Clitics in Spanish Causative Constructions,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005309/current.pdf?_s=H_AknbJN56fqGEds,"['Guajardo, Gustavo']","In Spanish causative constructions with dejar ‘let’ and hacer ‘make’ the subject of the embedded infinitive verb can appear in the accusative or the dative case. This case alternation has been accounted for by resorting to the notion of direct vs. indirect causation. Under this account, the accusative clitic with a transitive verb denotes direct causation while the dative clitic with an intransitive verb expresses indirect causation. The problem with this account is that we lack an independent definition of (in)direct causation in this context and so this approach suffers from circularity: the case of the clitic is used to determine causation type and causation type implies use of one or the other grammatical case. Therefore, a more objective way to account for clitic case alternation is needed. In this paper, I offer one possible solution in this direction by investigating clitic case alternation against Hopper and Thompson’s Transitivity parameters and a small number of other linguistic variables. The analysis is conducted on a dataset of 4,589 sentences analysed with Bayesian mixed-effects models and a large random forest. The results indicate that the transitivity of the infinitive verb, the animacy of the object and the agentivity of the subject are strong predictors of clitic case but there are also important dialectal differences. The findings in this paper allow us to arrive at a finer-grained characterization of the contexts in which each case is more likely to occur and provide further evidence of the pervasiveness of Transitivity in natural language.

Figure reflexive constructions are syntactically unified by the fact that their internal argument is conceptualized as a prepositional small clause, which introduces the Figure-Ground relation. These constructions are also Voiced, in the sense that an external argument position is projected even if it may be non-thematic. Unaccusatives are analyzed as introducing an expletive, i.e. non-thematic Voice projection, whose role is simply to signal that the event structure of transitives and derived unaccusatives is the same, consisting of a causing subevent and a result state. The discussion of unaccusatives is theoretically relevant in that it strengthens the suggestion that there is a connection between the expletivization of Voice and derived reflexive unaccusativity.","['reflexive constructions', 'figure-ground relation', 'expletive voice', 'derived unaccusatives', 'romanian', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

To account for the distribution of concord exponents, I develop a model that allows features to be present in syntax but avoid realization. In particular, I propose that (i) Spell-Out applies to a node as soon as its Merge and Agree features are satisfied; (ii) Agree features are by default ineligible at PF and need to undergo Probe Conversion in order to get accessible to PF processes.

In morphologically simplex words, inflectional suffixes assign accent to a position in the stem, which is mapped to primary stress. This accent-to-stress algorithm results in an ‘opposite-to-anchor’ system whereby the location of primary stress is towards the left edge but the triggering suffix is towards the right. In contrast to simplex forms, this mapping does not occur with complex forms, e.g. verbs with both inflectional and derivational morphology. Because Ese Ejja is a polysynthetic language, a large number of derivational morphemes can intervene between the root (at left) and triggering suffixes (at right), which may result in ‘long-distance anchor dependencies’. Ese Ejja conspicuously avoids this situation by suspending accent-to-stress mapping in sufficiently complex forms. Instead, a kind of ‘stress uniformity’ is employed whereby complex forms copy the stress from an equivalent simplex form (i.e. [[ROOT]-INFL]x --> [[[ROOT]-DERIV]-INFL]x, where x = identical stress). This chapter relates these aspects of Ese Ejja stress to the rarity of opposite-to-anchor systems generally (such as ‘count systems’), and the general bias in stress systems for default-to-same-edge properties.","['stress', 'accent', 'morphologically-conditioned prosody', 'polysynthesis', 'paradigm uniformity', 'transparadigmatic uniformity', 'inflection vs. derivation', 'amazonian languages', 'ese ejja', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2020

Morphosyntax and Phonology of Agreement in Turkish,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005215/current.pdf?_s=WoMyDUCuULleKesU,"['Gunes, Guliz']","This paper offers a new morphosyntactic account of subject agreement in the Turkish verbal domain. The account is based on well-known, novel, and some excluded observations about the distribution and prosody of verbal agreement. In Turkish, when certain morphosyntactic requirements are met and when the verb is focused, the agreement morpheme can be optionally parsed inside or outside of the prosodically prominent part of the verbal domain. I claim that this optionality is a reflex of how the morphemes that constitute the verbal domain are post-syntactically concatenated. In particular, I argue that an agreement morpheme either lowers together with its host (full lowering); or is stranded when its host lowers (partial lowering). In full lowering, agreement is contained within the prominent part of the verbal domain, whereas in partial lowering, agreement falls outside of this prominence domain. I also show that prosodic variability is observed only when the non-canonical medial and double realization of agreement is possible. The Vocabulary Insertion rules that are postulated for the subject agreement paradigms of the Turkish verbal domain capture the possible cases of medial and double agreement and successfully predict in which environments medial agreement is optional and in which environments it is obligatory.

In another paper that is recently published, I discuss whether or not an alternative analysis, i.e. reduplication plus deletion which was originally suggested for Spanish Agr doubling, works for Turkish medial and double agreement cases.

Computing and classifying reduplication with 2-way finite-state transducers,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005279/current.pdf?_s=pWdUXCIeCHO2khs1,"['Dolatian, Hossep', 'Heinz, Jeffrey']","This article describes a novel approach to the computational modeling of reduplication. Reduplication is often treated as a stumbling block within finite-state treatments of morphology because they cannot adequately capture the productivity of unbounded copying (total reduplication) and because they cannot describe bounded copying (partial reduplication) without a large increase in the number of states. We provide a comprehensive typology of reduplicative processes and show that an understudied type of finite-state machines, two-way deterministic finite-state transducers (2-way D-FSTs), captures virtually all of them. Furthermore, the 2-way FSTs have few states, are in practice easy to design and debug, and are linguistically motivated in terms of the transducer's origin semantics or segment alignment. Most of these processes, and their corresponding 2-way D-FSTs are available in an online database of reduplication (RedTyp). We classify these 2-way D-FSTs according to the concatenation of known subclasses of regular relations and show that the majority fall into the Concatenated Output Strictly Local (C-OSL) class. Other cases require higher subclasses but are still definable by 2-way D-FSTs.

The different meanings of the suffix -CIk are due to two different structures that I propose.  While the structure of the diminutive is made of one single morpheme -CIk, that of the augmentative suffix is composed of two morphemes: -CI and -k. I offer phonotactic and morphological evidence that shows -k has its own life. I also show strict categorical selection properties for the diminutive and augmentative suffix: The augmentative one can only be attached to adjectival bases that express negative orderings. The diminutive -CIk, on the other hand, attaches to nouns.

Gender and Number in Tunisian Arabic: A case of contextual allosemy,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005266/current.pdf?_s=16imIxW4Uuyx2H40,"['Dali, Myriam']","In this thesis, I investigate the distribution and function(s) of gender in Tunisian
Arabic. Based on the observation that gender can ll multiple functions and hence
receive different interpretations in TA, I consider gender in this language to be subject
to contextual allosemy. Allosemy is the equivalent of conditioned allomorphy at the
level of LF (Wood, 2012; Marantz, 2013;Wood and Marantz, 2017) and is dened as a
phenomenon in which a single morpheme can have multiple semantic realizations. My
proposal is based on the observation that the interpretation of gender is conditioned
by its syntactic environment, more specifically, by the class of the base noun and the
function and interpretation of any node or abstract morpheme (e.g., number) that
is parasitic of the n head hosting the class feature.
The current predominant view of gender in syntactic theory is that it has a
nominalizing function (Lecarme, 2002; Kihm, 2005; Lowenstamm, 2008; Acquaviva,
2009; Kramer, 2009, 2014, 2015; Hammerly, 2018). According to this view, gender
is hosted on the n head, which selects the root, and assigns it a nominal category
(assuming DM). However, Arabic has other uses for the feminine gender, most of
them associated with number. This, I argue, originates from the diachronic trajectory
of the feminine affix -a in Proto-Semitic, where it started out as a nominalizer,
then a singulative affix, then a group marker, before finally marking feminine gender
(Hasselbach, 2014a,b; Dali and Mathieu, 2019a). These subsequent layers of meanings
associated with what is now known as gender are all present in the synchronic
picture of Arabic. Through an exhaustive inventory of data and diagnostics, I show
that the role of gender is pervasive within the Tunisian Arabic DP, and is not limited
to nominalization. To account for these facts, I propose that gender is distributed
among the different functional heads of the DP: Num, Q, D (see also Farkas 1990;
Ritter 1993; Giurgea 2008; Croitor and Giurgea 2009; Steriopolo and Wiltschko 2010;
Fassi Fehri 2012, 2018b,a; Dali and Mathieu 2019a).
The present thesis also focuses on plurals. I show that plural markers can also
be distributed along the nominal spine (Acquaviva, 2008; Harbour, 2008; Wiltschko,
2008, 2012; Butler, 2012; Mathieu, 2012, 2013, 2014; Kramer, 2016), accounting for
their different functions (e.g., classifying, grouping, counting). These different functions
associated with Arabic plurals are, I argue, due to the existence of a singulative
operator that is not limited to the collective system, but is pervasive in Tunisian Arabic,
as I show. Finally, these observations all suggest that one and the same abstract
morpheme (e.g., the feminine and the plural) can receive different interpretations
depending on the base they attach to and on their syntactic level, which motivates
the allosemic analysis put forward in this thesis.","['arabic', 'gender', 'allosemy', 'number', 'plural', 'singulative', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Lexical accents are underlying foot edges: Evidence from Vedic Sanskrit,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005186/current.pdf?_s=peyeClTLrtpFW9BO,"['Yates, Anthony']","This paper is concerned with the lexical representation of accentedness — i.e., the property by which certain morphemes attract word-level stress in languages in which its surface distribution is not phonologically predictable. Recent constraint-based approaches to this question diverge in whether a lexical accent is (i) an abstract prominence autosegmentally linked to an input vowel, which is thus preferentially incorporated into metrical structure (Revithiadou 1999, 2007, Alderete 2001, i.a.); or (ii) metrical structure directly pre-specified in the input (Inkelas 1999, Özçelik 2014, i.a.). I argue that only (ii) can account for the distribution of word stress in Vedic Sanskrit (Indic, Indo-European). Crucial evidence for this proposal comes from cases in which an accented vowel is eliminated in the output, which results in an apparent rightward stress shift  (termed ``secondary mobility'' by Kiparsky 2010). I show that only on the metrical analysis is it possible to reconcile these rightward shifts with the phonological preference for left edge stress otherwise observed in the language.","['word prosody', 'lexical accent', 'metrical stress', 'sanskrit', 'optimality theory', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2020

In this squib, I review the three case studies and show that the argument for analyzing West-Germanic complementizer agreement as allomorphy does not hold up. In addition, I discuss three new data points on complementizer agreement that cannot be analyzed with a PF account. Accepting that complementizer agreement is not allomorphy allows us to revise the diagnostics to distinguish allomorphy from agreement to a stricter set.","['complementizer agreement', 'agreement', 'allomorphy', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Defective Incorporating Verbs in Mandarin,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005177/current.pdf?_s=HPHW7etEUOOpSeRW,"['Zhang, Niina Ning']","This paper identifies a type of noun incorporation in which the verb and a nominal are combined as early saturation of the verb, in contrast to early restriction, which is seen in the familiar type of noun incorporation. Two types of V-V resultative constructions in Mandarin Chinese are compared: the agent-oriented one and the patient-oriented one. The semantic grouping effects of the first verb and the post-verbal nominal of an agent-oriented type show that they are local to each other in their base-positions. But unlike in the patient-oriented one, the first verb in the construction shows a weak reachability. The defectiveness of the verb is parallel to that of an incorporated nominal in the familiar type of noun incorporation: e.g., no modification and no anaphoric linking to a proform. The paper argues that the first verb in the agent-oriented resultative construction and the post-verbal nominal, which can be a full-fledged referential nominal, undergo a type of noun incorporation parallel to the familiar type. In such noun incorporation, instead of the nominal, it is the verb that exhibits root-like properties. Such properties are viewed as a consequence of an early combination of a verb and a nominal, before each of them takes an event-argument, in a neo-Davisonian semantic perspective.","['agent-oriented resultative', 'incorporation', 'restriction', 'saturation', 'mandarin', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

I introduce new data from a related language, Laz, and show that a close comparison of the two languages reveals that (i) number agreement is expressed omnivorously only if the prefix is not sensitive to number, and that (ii) this number expression covaries with Tense only if the subject is third person. I argue that both Anti-Superiority and the facts about number expression should be interpreted as fusional morphology being limited to third person contexts, and that a principled explanation for such an asymmetry can be provided, if first and second person structurally contain third person, and the matching of exponents with syntactic structure is governed by Overspecification (Starke 2009), such that a lexicalized span is a candidate of spellout for its sub-spans.","['georgian', 'laz', 'agreement', 'syntax-morphology interface', 'spans', 'person hierarchy', 'phi features', 'nanosyntax', 'distributed morphology', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

The term “morpheme” has three rather different meanings, and other terms such as “vocabulary item” are too abstract. The term “morph” can be used as the basis for defining other widely used terms such as “root”, “prefix”, and “suffix”, which are currently often defined as kinds of “morphemes”. It can also serve as the basis for a clearer definition of suppletion (involving suppletive morph sets) and morph variants, thus avoiding the confusions surrounding the term “allomorph(y)”.","['morpheme', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'terminology', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

The result of this is that nouns along the moving wh-phrase's movement path bear case-marking they would not otherwise have: ergative on otherwise-absolutive subjects, and dative on otherwise-absolutive objects.

Dual number and the typology of the numeral-noun construction,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005203/current.pdf?_s=yEMsxieTVSBOLDim,"['Martí, Luisa']","In this paper I lay down the theoretical groundwork for an extension of Martí’s (2020) theory of the numeral+noun construction (e.g., English 'three dogs') to languages that draw a distinction between singular, dual and plural in their nominal domain. Martí’s account hypothesizes that the number marking we see on nouns in this construction is the result of the interaction between the compositional semantics of number features, as conceived of in Harbour (2014), and of cardinal numerals, as conceived of in Scontras (2014) and others. Extending Martí’s account to singular-dual-plural languages makes concrete predictions about the types of number marking we should observe on their nouns when they combine with numerals, and the question that arises is whether these are the patterns that we indeed find cross-linguistically. I argue below that the numeral+noun construction in Yimas and Hopi conforms straightforwardly to these predictions. I also discuss Imere and Ljubljana Slovenian, languages which can be shown to conform to the predictions once a proper understanding of complex numerals (in the case of Ljubljana Slovenian) and number prefixes (in the case of Imere) is in place. The consideration of Ljubljana Slovenian requires an analysis for complex numerals, aspects of which I borrow from Ionin and Matushansky (2006, 2018) and adapt to fit Martí’s proposal.

Feature gluttony does not in and of itself lead to ungrammaticality, but rather can create irresolvably conflicting requirements for subsequent operations.

"Syntax, prosody, and metrical structure in Blackfoot",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005250/current.pdf?_s=DyRVdummE5XnUPd2,"['Weber, Natalie']","This dissertation investigates the correspondences between syntactic, prosodic, and metrical constituents in Blackfoot (Algonquian), a polysynthetic language. I propose that the syntax-prosody correspondence is distinct from the alignment of prosodic and metrical structure. In a parallel constraint-based model of phonology, this predicts that a language might satisfy isomorphic syntax-prosody correspondence at the expense of prosodic and metrical alignment, or vice versa. To determine the generalizations in Blackfoot, I gathered data by conducting fieldwork with speakers and consulting published reference materials. Some arguments in the dissertation are based on original morphological and phonological analyses of Blackfoot stems. 

For the syntax-prosody correspondence, I hypothesize that each syntactic phase corresponds to a particular prosodic constituent by default. Specifically, the vP phase (the predicate of events), matches to a Prosodic Word (PWd) constituent, and the DP and CP phases match to Phonological Phrase (PPh) constituents. I model these relationships using a modified version of Match Theory (Selkirk 2011), where mismatches between syntactic phases and prosodic structure only occur in order to satisfy prosodic wellformedness constraints. For the relation between prosody and metrical structure, I hypothesize that the edges of metrical constituents align to different prosodic constituents (prosodic word, phonological phrase, or intonational phrase). 

Regarding structure in Blackfoot, I argue that a constraint which requires sister nodes within the prosodic structure to be of the same type outranks the syntax-prosody MATCH constraints. This forces each DP argument and also the remainder of the CP (e.g. the verbal complex) to be matched to a PPh constituent. The vP phase and every higher vP projection corresponds to a PWd constituent, which is distinct from the PPh. I argue that the metrical constituents in Blackfoot align to PPh edges, and that syllables frequently span PWd edges. This is a predicted outcome, given that the MATCH and ALIGN constraints are violable. The model I propose accounts for the correspondence relations in Blackfoot, and leads to a typology of predicted language types, with implications for extending Match Theory to account for polysynthetic languages.","['prosody', 'syntax-phonology interface', 'prosodic structure', 'stress', 'match theory', 'blackfoot', 'algonquian', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2020

Syntactic ergativity and the theory of subjecthood: Evidence from anaphor binding in West Circassian,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005168/current.pdf?_s=WIhQBFhA30PkC3_V,"['Ershova, Ksenia']","This paper explores the notion of subjecthood in West Circassian, a polysynthetic language with ergative alignment, by analyzing patterns of anaphor binding, a standard subjecthood diagnostic. The two types of anaphors in the language, reflexives and reciprocals, seem to display an opposite directionality in binding: reflexives appear to provide evidence for a syntactically accusative clause structure, with the ergative external argument c-commanding the absolutive theme, while reciprocals provide evidence for a syntactically ergative clause structure wherein the absolutive theme c-commands and binds the ergative agent. The close examination of the expression of reflexive and reciprocal relations in a variety of contexts uncovers the generalization that both types of pronouns behave as standard anaphors subject to standard locality conditions on binding, but reflexives are additionally constrained by a licensing condition which limits their set of possible antecedents to the highest argument in the theta-domain. The puzzling mismatch in binding directionality is thus reduced to well-understood and cross-linguistically attested patterns. The paper sheds light on the syntactic conditions governing anaphor licensing and on the role of subjecthood as a type of syntactic primitive: in West Circassian, subjecthood diagnostics fail to single out a single nominal as a subject, thus rendering this notion theoretically vacuous.","['ergativity', 'subject', 'subjecthood', 'reflexive', 'reciprocal', 'binding', 'west circassian', 'adyghe', 'northwest caucasian', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

The second approach, laid out in Arregi and Nevins (2012), posits a distinct Fission operation which occurs derivationally prior to Vocabulary Insertion, splitting up certain features and copying all others. I argue for the latter approach on the basis of a novel set of allomorphic alternations which demonstrate that Fission (and linearization) feed (and therefore cannot be equated with) Vocabulary Insertion. I argue that a detailed comparison of discontinuous agreement paradigms across Semitic languages provides strong evidence for a modular view of the postsyntactic component whose operations are constrained by higher order principles such as locality and featural markedness.","['morphology', 'fission', 'discontinuous agreement', 'allomorphy', 'semitic']",2020

Evidence for this claim comes from three code-switching varieties: Basque/Spanish, German/Turkish and Russian/Kazakh.

We find that if K is drawn from the lexicon of a non-concord language, constituents within the noun phrase adopt a default morphology. It is suggested that the data presented in this paper provide evidence for approaches that take Concord to be a form of Agree (probe,goal) and against an approach that takes it to be the result of feature percolation from the bottom up.

In other empirical domains, phonological principles still account for many of the attested data. Yet, one attests lexicalised exceptions as well, which are clearly phonologically non-optimal. The data echo opposing views in the literature: some proposals attempt to reduce allomorph selection to phonology, others focus on the fact that many examples are simply not phonologically optimal and suggest that allomorph selection should not be done by Phonology. I argue that the opposing nature of these two types of data is actually indicative of the way the selection of allomorphs is organised. More specifically, both Vocabulary Insertion and Phonology can determine the selection of allomorphs.

We propose that plural personal pronouns consist of two parts: a set of variables, {X, Y}, that determine the form of the pronoun, and an NP annex, which constrains the interpretation of the Y variable. Typically, the annex is phonetically silent (bare plural pronouns), but the Icelandic construction is unusual in that the annex is partly overt, thereby allowing a rare insight into the construction of plural personal pronouns.","['icelandic', 'inclusory constructions', 'plural pronoun constructions', 'plural pronouns', 'pro[np]', 'pro[x-np]', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

Crucial data comes from local person pronominal clefts derived from islands (bound pronoun context) and parasitic gaps (movement copy context). Inspired by van Urk (2017), I analyze this pattern using Landau's (2006) theory of chain reduction in which only movement copies create chains and are then subject to an algorithm which deletes person features.","['resumption', 'swahili', 'chain reduction', 'movement', 'pronouns', 'person features', 'copy deletion', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

Additionally, certain morphemes can be specified in the lexicon as possessing these diacritics. The phonology then interprets the diacritics—sometimes it ignores them, and other times, it makes phonological words to satisfy language-specific prosodic requirements. The resulting theory is demonstrated on the complex patterning of prepositions in Russian. The class of prepositions in Russian has certain syntactic traits in common, but there are many patterns where prepositions diverge according to their phonological word status. There are correlations between morphosyntactic structure and phonological word status: morphologically complex prepositions are always words. On the other hand, the presence of a morphological root, phonological size, and stress do not align with word status. The large range of phonological and morphosyntactic patterns involving prepositions in Russian demonstrates the need for an explicit and rich theory of word formation at the phonology-syntax interface.","['syntax-phonology interface', 'prepositions', 'phonological words', 'prosody', 'clitics', 'second position clitics', 'approximative inversion', 'split scrambling', 'ellipsis', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2020

Applied arguments in Spanish inchoative middle constructions,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005026/current.pdf?_s=fMiSOMFpa486UZXD,"['Suarez-Palma, Imanol']","Despite displaying identical exponents (a reflexive clitic, imperfective tenses and agreement between the verb and the preverbal definite DP theme), change-of-state predicates in generic/middle contexts (inchoative middles, henceforth), can in fact have two different underlying representations: (i) a generic inchoative and (ii) a generic se-passive, this being the only one projecting a Voice head passivized by the reflexive clitic, which denotes an implicit generic external argument. Spanish allows the insertion of an affected applicative head in inchoative configurations (Cuervo 2003), which introduces an unselected dative argument interpreted either as an unintentional causer of the event if merged above the verbalizing head, or as affectee if merged below it. Crucially, this paper shows that the generic passive configuration disallows the applicative’s unintentional causer interpretation, since the position above vP is already filled by Voice; therefore, the only available merging position for the applicative is below vP. However, the unintentional causer interpretation is possible in generic inchoative constructions, which lack a VoiceP. The data and analysis presented here support Wood and Marantz’s (2017) proposal of a single argument-introducing head whose category and interpretation vary in terms of the syntactic context it is merged in. Finally, this study stresses the need to establish a more detailed classification of Spanish se-constructions as a whole and middles in particular with respect to their interaction with applied arguments.","['causative alternation', 'applicatives', 'passives', 'unaccusatives', 'middle constructions', 'datives', 'voice', 'romance se', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020
Experience with a linguistic variant affects the acquisition of its sociolinguistic meaning: An alien-language-learning experiment,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005049/current.pdf?_s=4j4Bl9HoCrqsHEZQ,"['Lai, Wei', 'Rácz, Péter', 'Roberts, Gareth']","How do speakers learn the social meaning of different linguistic variants, and what factors influence how likely a particular social–linguistic association is to be learned? It has been argued that the social meaning of more salient variants should be learned faster, and that learners' pre-existing experience of a variant will influence its salience.  In this paper we report two artificial-language-learning experiments investigating this. Each experiment involved two language learning stages followed by a test. The first stage introduced the artificial language and trained participants in it, while the second stage added a simple social context using images of cartoon aliens. The first learning stage was intended to establish participants' experience with the artificial language in general and with the distribution of linguistic variants in particular. The second stage, in which linguistic stimuli were accompanied by images of particular aliens, was intended to simulate the acquisition of linguistic variants in a social context. In our first experiment we manipulated whether a particular linguistic variant, associated with one species of alien in the second learning phase, had been encountered in the first learning phase. In the second experiment we manipulated whether the variant had been encountered in the same grammatical context. In both cases we predicted that the unexpectedness of a new variant or a new grammatical context for an old variant would increase the variant's salience and facilitate the learning of its social meaning. This is what we found, although in the second experiment, the effect was driven by better learners. Our results suggest that unexpectedness increases the salience of variants and makes their social distribution easier to learn, deepening our understanding of the role of individual language experience in the acquisition of sociolinguistic meaning.","['artificial-language learning', 'social meaning', 'sociolinguistics', 'salience', 'surprisal', 'expectation violation', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2020

The first includes an exceptive marker carrying [Acc-Case] ‘accusative case’ and [DS] ‘domain subtraction’ features when the ExP is an adjunct introduced by late Merge. The second includes a negative determiner which selects and c-commands the exceptive particle and deactivates/ suspends its [Acc-Case], consequently, the case feature of the ExP-complement is valued by percolation from D which combines with the exceptive marker to form a discontinuous focus particle with a [DR] ‘domain restriction’ feature.","['adjunction', 'case valuation', 'conjunction', 'ellipsis', 'exception', 'feature percolation', 'negation', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2020

While statistical learning is sometimes thought to be at odds with UG, I review how statistical learning can both complement UG and help us refine our ideas about the contents of UG. I first review some cognitively-plausible statistical learning mechanisms that can operate over a predefined hypothesis space, like those UG creates. I then review two sets of examples: (i) those where statistical learning allows more efficient navigation through a UG-defined hypothesis space, and (ii) those where statistical learning can replace prior UG proposals for navigating a hypothesis space, and in turn lead to new ideas about how UG might construct the hypothesis space in the first place.

A shared suffix between (participial) relatives and nominalizations is cross-linguistically widespread, for instance, it is frequently observed in Uralic, Altaic and Tibeto-Burman languages. We lay out the hypothesis space for an explanatory account of the cross-linguistic participle-nominalizer polysemy, and discuss which of the hypotheses is best suited to capture the Udmurt facts in particular. We discuss three ways of unifying participles and nominalizations: (a) the shared suffix is verbal and nominalizations involve mixed projections, (b) the shared suffix is verbal, but nominalizations are in fact relative clauses modifying a covert noun and (c) the shared suffix is nominal, thus, relative clauses are nominalized. We show that the Udmurt suffix -m is employed in relative clauses and deverbal nouns which correspond to verbal gerunds and result nouns. We argue that the suffix is verbal rather than nominal. We analyze relative clauses as bare participial modifiers and gerunds as mixed projections.

I argue for three separate but interrelated claims: (i) Georgian exhibits genuine, structurally constrained root suppletion, supporting a late insertion view contra Borer (2014); (ii) Bobaljik & Harley (2017)’s generalization that all intransitive verbs which supplete for number are unaccusatives can be upheld; (iii) a unified analysis for root suppletion and the preverb da- is possible.

Icelandic nominalizations and allosemy,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005004/current.pdf?_s=icNrpnoY7Thm-cbA,"['Wood, Jim']","The broad aim of this book is to bring a basic, but detailed description of Icelandic nominalizations to bear on the general theoretical and architectural issues that nominalizations have raised since the earliest work in generative syntax. While nominalization has long been central to theories of argument structure, and Icelandic has been an important language for the study of argument structure and syntax, Icelandic has not been brought into the general body of theoretical work on nominalization. In this book, I show that Icelandic-specific issues in the analysis of derived nominals have broad implications that go beyond the study of that one language. In particular, Icelandic provides special evidence that Complex Event Nominals (CENs), which seem to inherit their argument structure from the underlying verbs, can be formed without nominalizing a full verb phrase. This conclusion is at odds with prominent theories of nominalization which claim that CENs have the properties that they have precisely because they involve the nominalization of full verb phrases. 

More narrowly, I aim to develop the theory of allosemy within the framework of Distributed Morphology to account for the ambiguity of nominalizations and inheritance of argument structure. In so doing, I will show how one single syntactic structure can get distinct semantic interpretations corresponding to the range of readings that are available to derived nominals. The idea is that just as the phonological realization of terminal nodes is underspecified in syntax (so that before Vocabulary Insertion, past tense -ed and past tense -t are the same T[PAST] head), the semantic interpretation of terminal nodes is underspecified in syntax as well. Late insertion at LF inserts suppletive allosemes---semantic denotations---into terminal nodes that are underspecified semantically. I argue that the single structure at issue derives a noun from a verb before any arguments are attached, by adjoining a lexical root to a v(erb) head and adjoining the resulting verb to a n(oun) head. In addition to showing how an account grounded in allosemy can derive the ambiguity, I also explore the consequences of building nominalizations entirely with complex heads for the locality of special meanings, and articulate the function of prepositions and prefixing in Icelandic lexical meaning. 

The result is a broad argument for what Icelandic nominalizations tell us about argument structure and the syntax-semantics interface, along with an articulated theoretical proposal that makes several novel claims about the syntax-semantics interface within Distributed Morphology.

Thus, the verb GO in many IA languages can appear as a light verb in verb-verb [VV] compounds, contributing various more functional semantic components including completion.

Although VV compounds are a clear areal feature of South Asia, at lower levels of analysis we find obvious and substantial differences in the structure, interpretation, and frequency of use of VVs across South Asia, including significant differences even between closely related languages. Hindi VVs occur in a more restricted range of contexts , while VVs in Nepali and Marathi are less restricted. The strength of restrictions on licensed environments for VVs appears to co-vary with the frequency of occur of VVs overall. Thus Hindi VVs appear to display an overall greater frequency of occurrence than do Nepali VVs.

Diachronically, the INDC affix was a prefix in Middle Armenian, and in most modern Western Armenian lects like Standard Western. But in some dialects, the affix is mobile and its placement is determined by phonological, syntactic, and prosodic factors. In Hamshen, the only factor is phonological. The morpheme is a prefix in V-initial words and a suffix elsewhere. In Gyumri and Akhalkalkali, there are additional syntactic factors involved. In general, C-initial verbs take the suffix but can exceptionally take the prefix under specific syntactic conditions. In Akhalkalaki, affix order is additionally influenced from sentential prosody. The morpheme can leave the verb and cliticize onto the stressed constituent.","['armenian', 'mobile affix', 'mobile clitic', 'clitic', 'affix order', 'linearization', 'allomorphy', 'focus', 'information structure', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2019

This paper provides an overview of lexical and clausal nominalization in Esahie, a relatively underdescribed and undocumented Kwa language. We show that in Esahie, lexical nominalizations lose
all verbal properties whilst clausal nominalizations retain certain verbal features. Overall,
nominalization in Esahie is typically a case of lexical rather than clausal nominalization. Lexical
nominalizations in Esahie may take the form of simple affixation, parasynthesis or compounding.
We also provide further empirical support against Aronoff’s (1976) Unitary Base Hypothesis and
show that certain inflectional operators in Esahie belong to the group of word-class-changing
inflectional markers (cf. Haspelmath 1996; Bauer 2004). Data used in this work emanates from a
series of fieldworks conducted in the Western-North region of Ghana, and the argumentation

The syntax in Tlingit verbs,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005047/current.pdf?_s=wIJJdmlgNxY841GT,"['Crippen, James']","Tlingit verbs appear to be single phonological words but they are constructed from a large number of distinct morphological elements that correspond to argument structure, event structure, aspect, mood, modality, tense, and qualia. Previous analyses have accounted for the verbal morphology of Tlingit with opaque position class template systems. These systems present the internal structure of verbs as arbitrary and do not address the many dependencies between elements. This dissertation argues that the Tlingit verb implements a regular syntax with each morpheme instantiating a syntactic terminal. Ordering within the verb word is a consequence of regular syntactic structure with all dependencies between elements reflecting selection and agreement phenomena. The verb-internal syntax requires no extraordinary theoretical mechanisms: Tlingit verb morphology is neither unique nor problematic from a theoretical perspective.

To demonstrate this argument, this dissertation develops a formal theoretical model of Tlingit verbal structure within the Minimalist Program framework. An acategorial root forms the basis of the syntactic structure, encoding the majority of lexical properties. Other verbal morphology is either functional heads such as v, Voice, and Asp, or minimal lexical elements such as D pronouns or N incorporates. As well as phonological form and encyclopedic meaning, roots also encode valency, qualia, durativity, stativity, and irrealis, along with other morphosyntactic properties. These properties influence both the syntactic functions and semantic interpretations of the functional heads, so that the syntax and semantics of each head is contextually dependent, fully predictable and compositional. Long distance dependencies arise from selection, movement, and agreement between heads. Every morpheme either saturates or restricts an event or an argument, thus predictably contributing to the structure and interpretation of the whole verb. Movement and spellout are determined by phases which correspond to regular domains in the phonological verb word and phrase. Careful attention is paid to many supposedly irregular or lexical phenomena, showing that most are extensions of regular phenomena, and that some actually reflect underdocumented grammatical patterns. The results of this research have many implications for linguistic theory and for related Na-Dene languages and provide a robust analytical foundation for Tlingit language teaching and revitalization.

We argue that the pattern Rolle identifies in Degema SVCs instead results from the simultaneous interaction of two independently-attested syntax-prosody phenomena: (1) the pressure for adjacent verbs in an SVC to form a single prosodic unit, and (2) the suppression of redundant agreement within a single prosodic word (a.k.a. 'Kinyalolo's Generalization'). Thus the Degema SVC conspiracy can be localized to the syntax-prosody interface, and there is no need to adopt a unified morphology-prosody postsyntactic module.

We demonstrate that loss of morphological case and gender is the result of substantial language change over the course of two generations: while the case and gender system of the spoken medium was already beginning to undergo morphological syncretism and show some variation prior to World War II, case and gender distinctions were clearly present in the mental grammar of both Hasidic and non-Hasidic speakers of the relevant Yiddish dialects at that stage. We conclude the paper by identifying some of the language-internal, sociolinguistic and historical factors that have contributed to such rapid and pervasive language change, and compare the developments in Stamford Hill Hasidic Yiddish to those of minority German dialects in North America.","['yiddish', 'case', 'gender', 'language change', 'determiners', 'agreement', 'concord', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

Index in Sign Language: An interface requirement in search of features,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002446/current.pdf?_s=BsxPBwcW__1F5g95,"['Sinha, Samar']","The centrality of feature in syntax upholds the view that features or feature bundles drive the syntactic computations (Chomsky 1995); suggests that the syntactic projections are drawn identifying each head with a single feature (Kayne 1994), and eventually attaining the size of a morpheme, a word and a phrase (Starke 2009). Such feature based account introduces a sense that syntax is “language-free” (see Starke 2009 for details); cross-linguistic similarities and differences are rather due to the feature/s, and all linguistic phenomena and structures can be analysed syntactically which can be summarised as 'there are features, and none other enters into computation.'
	This tenet seems to be promising in cross-linguistic, cross-modality studies specially in the study of various aspects of structure in sign language which have no parallel in spoken language which are generally dubbed as sign language universals. One such phenomenon is a type of pointing gesture in sign language that the signer uses to point to someone or something either manually and/or non-manually with the eye gaze or the body orientation. It is often labelled as INDEX, and is used to refer to an object, referents, spatial location, or events around the signer and the addressee in a common observable space. In sign language literature, such phenomena are generally ascribed to the modality differences that the sign language employ. Such ascriptions, however, paradoxically fail to provide account of phenomena arising from the same C-I system as the difference between sign and spoken language is the difference of the S-M system that impose different optimal conditions for convergence rather than the difference of the C-I system. 
	This paper aims to address that the 'modality differences' do not make sign language unique by virtue of its S-M system, rather the interface requirements of the S-M system creates the differences in terms of the feature, and INDEX refers to such feature(s). It aims to provide an account of the structure building feature(s) associated with various instances of INDEX in Indian Sign Language based on feature inventory sugggested by Wiltschko (2009), Nevins (2007), Harbour (2006), Déchaine and Wiltschko (2002, 2007), Ghomeshi, Paul and Wiltschko (2009), etc. among others.

Most of these terms are traditional terms that are given a standard retro-definition, because linguists already behave as if these terms had the same meaning for everyone. The definitions are definitions of general concepts (i.e. comparative concepts, applicable to all languages in exactly the same way), but they are expected to be highly similar to language-particular categories with the same labels. If linguists were close to finding out the true natural-kind categories of Human Language that all grammars consist of, there would be no need for definitions, but since this seems to be a remote goal, research on general linguistics must rely on uniformly defined general terms.","['morphology', 'syntax', 'terminology', 'general linguistics']",2019

Here I argue that all these patterns can be understood in terms of the usual association of role rank (highly ranked A and R, low-ranked P and T) and referential prominence (locuphoric person, animacy, specificity, etc.). At the most general level, the role-reference association universal says that deviations from usual associations of role rank and referential prominence tend to be coded by longer grammatical forms. In other words, A and R tend to be referentially prominent in language use, while P and T are less prominent, and when less usual associations need to be expressed, languages often require special coding by means of additional flags (case- markers and adpositions) or additional verb coding (e.g. inverse or passive markers). I argue that role-reference association is an instance of the even more general pattern of form-frequency correspondence, and that the coding asymmetries can all be explained by frequency-based predictability and coding efficiency.","['differential object marking', 'person case constraint', 'ditransitive', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

The Romance languages have the potential to contribute substantially to this area of investigation, since they have a wide geospatial distribution, a long history of contact with several typologically diverse languages, and are abundantly documented.

Historical-Comparative Variation in Romance Differential Object Marking,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004623/current.pdf?_s=lY9CBT3l9InqoWw9,"['Tse, Keith']","While the use of Romance preposition ad as a Case-marker in Romance Differential Object Marking (DOM) is widely attested in Western Romance varieties (Rolhfs (1971), Nocentini (1985)), there has not yet been a comprehensive and systematic description of the comparative Romance data which reveals interesting microvariations in different systems of DOM across Romance varieties. This paper seeks to account for the historical-comparative distribution of ad as a DOM-marker in Romance by resorting to well-established DOM-parameters in the nominal and verbal domains (Serzant and Witzlack-Makarevich (2018)) as represented in cartographic models of Minimalist syntax (Cinque (1999, 2002)). Based on these premises, three macrotypes of Romance DOM are established and their common historical roots in Latin/proto-Romance are investigated.

In this paper, we explore whether pronoun movement, a type of movement that does not fit so neatly into a theory of attraction, can be brought closer together to wh-movement. In particular, we investigate whether it is possible to see effects of the Principle of Minimal Compliance (PMC) — an economy constraint that Richards (1998) proposes is active in multiple wh-movement — in the domain of Sierra Zapotec multiple pronoun movement.

This derives, V1, the affixation of functional morphology, and the lack of interpretive effects of head movement. I then show that optional phrasal movement targets the highest obviative argument in the clause, promoting it to Spec,#P and deriving a VOS/VSO alternation in direct alignments (where the object is obviative), and static VSO in inverse (where the subject is obviative). I further show that proximate subjects undergo movement to Spec,IP, while proximate objects are trapped within VoiceP. The analysis captures word order facts in both transitive and ditransitive clauses, suggests that indefinite proximate arguments are PPIs, forms a link between word order and agreement, and provides strong evidence that Ojibwe is a configurational language.","['ojibwe', 'algonquian', 'head movement', 'verb raising', 'v1', 'configurationality', 'word order', 'obviation', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

First, the common property behind this pattern is a syntactically unsatisfied subcategorization feature present in the Voice head, which is satisfied at PF through the introduction of the clitic se. Second, theta-roles are syntactic primitives that can be assigned in a long-distance fashion up to argument activity (aka syntactic visibility) plus some locality conditions. Third, at LF, theta-roles are semantically realized as functions from entities to event predicates (i.e., < e,< s, t >>) on K(ase) heads.

Dependent case and clitic dissimilation in Yimas,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003134/current.pdf?_s=xk3RKTxvI0a7bChV,"['Yuan, Michelle']","Baker (2015) suggests that the dependent theory of case (Marantz 1991, a.o.) is a formulation of the intuition that morphological case functions to differentiate nominals. This paper presents novel evidence for this idea from the agreement system of Yimas. Departing from previous characterizations of the language, this paper argues that the Yimas agreement morphemes are actually doubled pronominal clitics, and that they exhibit paradigmatic alternations that parallel the distributions of dependent case on nominals crosslinguistically. Crucially, clitic doubling in Yimas is optional; once this is taken into account, it is revealed that the morphological form of a given clitic covaries with the total number of clitics present, even when the sentence-level syntax is held constant: how a clitic is realized is thus dependent on its clitic environment. This context-dependence is analyzed as a dissimilation process, which applies to distinguish between multiple morphosyntactically indistinguishable clitics; this arises whenever multiple DPs are doubled. Thus, both clitic dissimilation in Yimas and dependent case on nominals can be viewed as alternations that are controlled by morphosyntactic context, albeit in different structural domains.","['dependent case', 'clitic doubling', 'yimas', 'syntax', 'morphology', 'dissimilation']",2019

However, there are debates on what makes human language exclusive. Among these debates, the most persuasive view is that human language is unique by the virtue of infinite syntactic recursion, which is universal to all human languages. The latest development of this view is backed by certain biological investigation and duly criticized by other scholars. In this paper, I argue that language is not a single product of a solitary process of evolution of the so-called linguistic species Homo sapiens. Thus, syntactic recursion may not be the universal aspect of all human languages. Syntactic recursion can be imagined only as an essential property of some developed languages that may not always be empirically observable. To consider human language as exclusive, I argue that human language in-itself is such a field where context-specific choice-based linguistic expressions are made up of certain syntagmatic relationships. These are substituted paradigmatically, instead of imagining language as a result of syntactic recursiveness, the fundamental function of universal grammar.

We  will  first  show  that  participle  agreement  only  occurs  in  contexts  where  the  participle  is  adjectival, viz., in stative passives and in resultative perfects, but not in eventive perfects. The 
 participles  thus  pattern  with  predicative  adjectives,  which  also  display  agreement  in  these  varieties. In the main part of the paper, we address double compound perfects and eventive passives, which also display agreement on the lexical participle. Even though it is initially not 
obvious that the  participle is adjectival in these cases, we will provide syntactic evidence for their adjectival  status. Furthermore, we will pursue the hypothesis that the adjectival head of all agreeing participles is a stativizer, even in the double compound perfect and the eventive passive. At the same time, both the double compound perfect and the eventive passive also clearly have an eventive component. We will model their behavior by treating the participles as mixed categories, viz., as adjectival heads that take a large amount of verbal structure as their complement (VoiceP/AspP). While recent work on German stative passives has argued that even those should be analyzed as containing a substantial amount of verbal structure, the behavior 
of participles in the double perfect and the eventive passive in the varieties under consideration is clearly different. They thus contribute to the typology of adjectival passives in German and beyond and show that the familiar distinction between ‘adjectival’ and ‘verbal’ participles needs

The second type of circumstance is when the form that corresponds to the two required cases is syncretic. I propose an analysis that combines Caha’s (2009) case hierarchy in Nanosyntax with Van Riemsdijk’s (2006a) concept of Grafting. By placing case features as separate heads in the syntax, a less complex case can be Grafted into a different clause, explaining the first type of circumstance. The second type makes reference to the fact that syncretic forms are inserted via the same lexical entry (Superset Principle). A cross-linguistic comparison shows that it is language-specific whether a more complex case requirement in the main or embedded clause causes non-matching non-syncretic free relatives to be grammatical. For all languages it holds that the relative pronoun appears in the most complex case required, which provides additional evidence for case being complex and more complex cases being able to license less complex cases.","['free relatives', 'syncretism', 'case hierarchy', 'nanosyntax', 'grafting', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

Here, we continue to use a picture selection task but expand our focus to include 1st and 2nd person markers, which are more phonologically salient and less complex to interpret than 3rd person markers. We find that preschoolers comprehend Spanish 1st and 2nd person agreement markers early (2;3-2;11) and just as accurately as clitic pronouns, showing that comprehension of agreement is not uniformly difficult. In the 3rd person, accuracy was low not only for agreement but also for clitics, and both adults and children allowed these expressions to refer to a prominent referent from the immediately preceding discourse—even if that referent was the speaker or hearer. We argue that the production/comprehension asymmetry originally observed for 3rd person agreement was driven not just by task demands but also by children’s sensitivity to the discourse dependence of 3rd person referring expressions.

The primary evidence comes from the observation that predicate clefts require head displacement to derivationally feed overt A'-movement. Since overt A'-movement occurs before Spell-Out, head displacement also must. This challenges post-syntactic approaches to head displacement phenomena, but only if narrow-syntactic movement is modeled under the Copy Theory of Movement; multidominance requires post-syntactic head displacement.","['head movement', 'copy theory of movement', 'multidominance', 'predicate clefts', 'verb movement', ""a'-movement"", 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019
Case Interactions in Syntax,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003839/current.pdf?_s=Q5jAdJqoqo-1Fpgc,"['Coon, Jessica', 'Parker, Clint']","The phenomenon of case has been studied widely at both the descriptive and theoretical levels. Typological work on morphological case systems has provided a picture of the variability of case cross-linguistically. In particular, languages may differ with respect to whether or not arguments are marked with overt morphological case, the inventory of cases with which they may be marked, and the alignment of case marking (e.g. nominative-accusative vs. ergative-absolutive). In the theoretical realm, not only has morphological case been argued to play a role in multiple syntactic phenomena, but current generative work also debates the role of abstract case (i.e. Case) in the grammar: abstract case features have been proposed to underlie morphological case, and to license nominals in the derivation.

The phenomenon of case has been argued to play a role in at least three areas of the syntax: (i) agreement, (ii) A-movement, and (iii) A’-movement. Bobaljik (2008) provides convincing evidence that morphological case—rather than grammatical function—determines a nominal argument’s eligibility to participate in verbal agreement. Preminger (2014), building upon Bobaljik’s work, claims that languages vary as to whether movement to subject position is case-sensitive. As for case-sensitive A’-movement, recent literature debates whether this phenomenon should be seen as another instance of ‘case discrimination’ (Deal 2016c) or whether the pattern arises from other properties of ergative languages (e.g. Henderson and Coon 2016). Finally, other recent work (e.g. Brown 2016) has examined agreement and A’ extraction patterns in languages with no visible case morphology (e.g. Mayan, Tsimshianic, and Salishan languages). It is shown that the presence of patterns and typological gaps—both in languages with overt morphological case and in those without it—lends support to the relevance of abstract case in the syntax.","['case', 'agreement', 'a-movement', 'a’-movement', 'syntactic ergativity', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

Section 2 argues that characters have morphological operations akin to affixation, compounding, and reduplication. Section 3 argues that characters also have phonology (of a silent sort, as in sign languages), which describes abstract formal regularities in strokes and overall character shape. Section 4 provides corpus-based evidence for the productivity of many of the above regularities, and Section 5 provides experimental evidence.

Lexical Decomposition in Syntax: New Evidence from Ellipsis,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004694/current.pdf?_s=VC0t_nzmAm_y_Pby,"['Sato, Yosuke', 'Yu, Jianrong']","Over the last 25 years or so, researchers working on argument structure and verbal meanings have
accumulated a growing body of evidence that what appears to be a morphophonologically single verb
is in fact decomposed into a series of semantically contentful functional projections and roots (Hale
and Keyser 1993, Harley 1995, 2002, Kratzer 1996, Beck and Johnson 2004, to mention a few; see
Harley 2012 for a recent summary), suggesting a return to a sharply constrained minimalist syntactic
version of the deep insights of Generative Semantics (Morgan 1969; Lakoff 1970; McCawley 1971).
In this paper, we will furnish novel evidence for this decompositional theory of verb meanings
through a previously unexplored angle of VP-ellipsis. Our central observation is that VP-ellipsis can
target a sub-lexical constituent of a verb’s structured meaning. We formulate a condition on
VP-ellipsis that makes crucial reference to a superset-subset relation between the syntactic structures
of the antecedent and the elided constituent. We then use this condition on VP-ellipsis as a probe into
the articulated internal structure of VPs, (dis-)confirming particular decompositional analyses for
controversial cases of verbs such as kill, want, give, open, melt, etc.
A number of important implications arise from this work. Firstly, because the superset-subset
relation makes reference to (morpho-)syntactic identity, the data reported here constitute a powerful
argument that ellipsis must be sensitive to syntactic structure, not just phonological identity, as argued
in Goldberg (2005). Secondly, roots (or at least indices) must be present in the syntactic representation
(Harley 2004) to evaluate proper containment relations between the antecedent-ellipsis pairs for verbs
that show the causative-inchoative alternation, contra researchers who argue that roots are inserted late
post-syntactically (Halle and Marantz 1993; Marantz 1995; Haugen 2009; Haugen and Siddiqi 2013).
Lastly, granted that decompositional effects of verbs are real, the question remains whether the
relevant decomposition takes place in the syntax or at some other pre-syntactic level of representation
such as the GB-style lexicon or the so-called Lexical Conceptual Structure (Pustejovsky 1991; Levin
and Rappaport-Hovav 1995). Our results reported here show that the decomposition in question must
be represented within syntax, a theoretical conclusion that is also echoed in von Stechow (1995) and
Beck and Johnson (2004) in their analyses of scope ambiguities with again in double object verbs.","['lexical decomposition', 'generative semantics', 'fine structure of vps', 'prepositional have: transitive have', 'distributed morphology', 'timing of root insertion', 'root content', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019
Different Kinds of Second-position Clitics in Caquinte,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004272/current.pdf?_s=aGZfmHhcYTSZj93W,"['Rolle, Nicholas', ""O'Hagan, Zachary""]","This topic of this paper is kinds of second position (2P) clitics in Caquinte (Kampa Arawak: Peru). One sort are nominal 2P clitics which appear in nominal domains. The other sort, at least 25 clausal 2P clitics, appear in clausal domains. Neither sort ever appears in initial position, and may appear between words which otherwise form a syntactic constituent, e.g. [Adj=CL N] in the case of nominal clitics and [Dem=CL N] in the case of clausal clitics. Both sorts allow “stacking” (e.g., =ka=mpa=shine=te), but each is subject to distinct constraints on possible hosts. 

We provide an analysis of clausal clitics highlighting the behavior of two subtypes. First, we claim that all Caquinte clitics are prosodically deficient, as evidenced by stress shifts on the stem. We capture this by associating each clitic with a subcategorization frame (w [...]=CL) that indicates that it must have a host to its left, and together they form a phonological word w, following Inkelas (1990) and Bennett, Harizanov, and Henderson (2018), among others. Second, we argue that the [X]=CL constituent is formed via a post-syntactic operation and not through syntactic movement, supported by the fact that clitics can break up syntactic constituents. Third, we argue that clausal clitics are merged at different points on the clausal spine, which accounts for the distribution of the two clausal clitic subtypes. Taken together, 2P clitics stand at the intersection of syntax, morphology, and phonology, and constitute an essential case study of interface phenomena.","['clitics', 'second-position clitics', 'syntax-phonology interface', 'prosodic subcategorization', 'spellout', 'phonological words', 'caquinte', 'arawak', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2019
The Person Case Constraint: Unconditional Interfaces and Faultless Derivations [Dissertation],https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004874/current.pdf?_s=TbENT4NTCVxTPQ08,"['Yokoyama, Tomohiro']","This thesis advances a theoretical move toward a grammatical model devoid of interface conditions by proposing a novel feature-based structure-building mechanism. In the standardly assumed architecture of grammar, ungrammaticality is often explained in terms of a violation of some condition on an output of the syntactic module. However, some recent research in linguistics has attempted to move away from such an approach to ungrammaticality and proposed to reinterpret ungrammaticality as non-generability. In this approach, ill-formed structures are construed not as defective but as impossible to generate with the available syntactic operations. In order to advocate for the latter approach to ungrammaticality, this thesis examines an interface condition called the Person Licensing Condition (PLC), which was proposed to account
for a linguistic phenomenon known as the Person Case Constraint (PCC). It is shown in the thesis that the PLC fails to capture cross-linguistic variation in the PCC patterns and in the way illicit structures are remedied. It is further argued that previous, Agree-based accounts of the PCC variation, also reliant on an interface condition, cannot fully explain all the patterns and that they obscure the source of the variation.
This thesis proposes an alternative account of the PCC, which involves a version of Merge that is constrained by feature valuation, and what is known as articulated person features. The proposed syntactic system allows arguments to engage with each other by valuing the same unvalued feature, and this explains person restriction effects seen in the PCC patterns. Illicit argument combinations are underivable in the system, and an interface condition is not needed to account for ungrammaticality induced by the PCC. This novel account of the PCC also captures the variation fairly well, and because the variation is attributed to different ways
syntactic elements are featurally specified in different languages, the reason why we obtain such variation is clear. In defending the person features used in the proposed syntactic mechanism, this thesis also speaks to the typology of grammatical persons and shows that the same features explain not only syntactic restrictions like the PCC but also a variety of morphological neutralization phenomena.","['pcc', 'repair', 'features', 'merge', 'valuation', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

We develop a syntactic analysis that accounts for the quantitative patterns in our corpus, which further extends to concrete, and correct, predictions about unobserved forms.

Negation in Morphology,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004637/current.pdf?_s=xMrEDtrCaS6iW32h,"['De Clercq, Karen']","Negative markers are not a uniform category. They come in various types and, depending on their type, they take scope over a clause, a phrase or just a word. Low scope negative markers (LSN) like ""de-, dis-, un-, iN-, non-, -less"" are bound morphemes and have therefore been mainly studied within morphology, focussing on the semantics of these markers (contradiction vs. contrariety), issues related to their productivity, and their combinability with certain categories. Wide scope negative markers (WSN), like ""not"" are often free morphemes, and are usually treated within syntax. We could thus say that there is a morphology-syntax divide when it comes to the treatment of negative markers. 

However, there are reasons to give up this divide and to uniformly treat negative markers within one module of the grammar. First, from a typological point of view the bound-free divide of negative markers does not correlate with their scope. For instance, agglutinative languages have WSN markers that are bound morphemes attaching to the verbal base. Second, morphological processes, like suppletion or other types of allomorphy, can be observed in markers that show properties of WSN markers. Third, independent negative particles, like for instance the Dutch free morpheme ""weinig"" `little, few', shares stacking properties with other LSN markers like un- and iN-. Fourth, both LSN and WSN markers are subject to the same constraint concerning stacking scopally identical negative markers. Fifth, syncretisms have been found across languages between WSN and LSN, allowing negative markers to be ordered in such a way that no *ABA patterns arise, suggesting that the morphology of negative markers reflects the natural scope of negation and that there is a continuum between LSN and WSN markers.

Non-autonomous accusative case in Estonian,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004500/current.pdf?_s=_oUzihQpkzG42k7e,"['Norris, Mark']","In Estonian, some objects of verbs show an alternation in case-marking that seems to be conditioned by morphological number: genitive when singular, nominative when plural. According to traditional descriptions (Erelt et al. 1993, 2000) and some recent research (Miljan & Cann 2013), these objects are genitive/nominative syntactically and morphologically. This paper argues against this approach, proposing instead that these cases are the morphological realization of a non-autonomous syntactic accusative case, on the basis of two novel arguments. First, although isolated words in the language have no unique accusative form, the pseudopartitive construction does exhibit a unique form in would-be accusative contexts. Second, the genitive form of the inanimate relative pronoun (mille) can be replaced by nominative/unmarked mis, but only when it is in an object position. Though it has been proposed in the literature that Estonian has an accusative case (Hiietam 2003, 2005, Caha 2009), neither of these arguments has been discussed, and they provide compelling morphosyntactic evidence in favor of the proposal. Possible paths to an analysis of the accusative’s pervasive syncretism are discussed in the framework of Distributed Morphology. It is proposed that an analysis making use of Impoverishment is superior to one without. The investigation here constitutes an additional case study in the divide between syntactic case and morphological case (Deal 2016, Goddard 1982, Legate 2008, 2014, Spencer 2006).","['estonian', 'case', 'syncretism', 'pseudopartitives', 'impoverishment', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

In such constructions, only the final verb is inflected for tense, and -(i)p attaches to all non-final verbs in lieu of tense inflection. In some cases, the final verb is semantically bleached of its lexical meaning. I demonstrate that not all -(i)p constructions share a uniform structure; instead, they are formed through a variety of syntactic derivations involving adjunction, coordination or complementation. The -(i)p marker overtly realizes an Event head outside the verbal domain or an Inner Aspect head within the verbal domain whenever a structural configuration blocks one verb’s access to Tense inflection. The findings in this dissertation provide novel evidence for two event-related syntactic projections, and show that they can play a crucial role in allowing multiple verbs to appear within a clause. The study also demonstrates that there is no uniform syntactic structure for serial verb constructions. Instead, the way serial verb or other multi-verb constructions are formed is constrained by event structure.","['uyghur', 'multi-verb constructions', 'serial verb constructions', 'event', 'aspect', 'inner aspect', 'event structure', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

This pattern raises two important theoretical issues for Distributed Morphology (DM; Halle and Marantz (1993)). The first is whether or not the clitic status of a morpheme is encoded in the grammar. The second is the need for a theory of possible hosts for clitics. Based on the SJA Mam data, I conclude that the linearization instructions for the polar question clitic must reference the clitic status of its host, suggesting that clitics are different in crucial ways from other morphemes in the grammar.","['second position clitic', 'mayan', 'mam', 'linearization', 'clitic placement', 'local dislocation', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

I take as my empirical focus two interrelated case studies in Amahuaca syntax: 1) the split ergative case system, and 2) the extensive switch-reference system. In the domain of case, I argue that overt ergative case morphology in Amahuaca expones agreement of the transitive subject with multiple functional heads. This leads to a distinction between the features needed for abstract ergative case (agreement only with v), and the features needed to trigger overt ergative case (agreement with both v and T). This distinction between abstract and morphological case factors into the analysis of the switch-reference system of Amahuaca, which I argue is sensitive to abstract case. In addition to case-sensitivity, Amahuaca’s switch-reference system shows the typologically unusual property of tracking the reference of all arguments of the verb, not only subjects. I propose that this system arises through adjunct complementizer agreement that probes both the adjunct and matrix arguments directly through cyclic expansion of the probe. Through these two investigations, I conclude that Amahuaca provides support for a narrowly cyclic model of Agree in which each instance of Merge defines a new cycle of Agree (Rezac 2003, 2004; Béjar and Rezac 2009). Further, the empirical facts can be most straightforwardly accounted for if we assume that some probes are insatiable, agreeing with all possible goals in their search space (Deal 2015b). Finally, despite the fact that some agreement in Amahuaca appears to be long distance, I argue that the data can be captured under the fairly conservative assumption that Agree is always under c-command and is always phase-bound.","['syntax', 'morphosyntax', 'agree', 'case', 'ergativity', 'switch-reference', 'complementizer agreement', 'amahuaca', 'panoan', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

They are found in many of the world’s languages, and sizable lexical classes of ideophones are particularly well-documented in languages of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Ideophones are not limited to onomatopoeia like meow and smack, but cover a wide range of sensory domains, such as manner of motion (e.g., plisti plasta ‘splish-splash’ in Basque), texture (e.g., tsaklii ‘rough’ in Ewe), and psychological states (e.g., wakuwaku ‘excited’ in Japanese). Across languages, ideophones stand out as marked words due to special phonotactics, expressive morphology including certain types of reduplication, and relative syntactic independence, in addition to production features like prosodic foregrounding and common co-occurrence with iconic gestures.

Three intertwined issues have been repeatedly debated in the century-long literature on ideophones. 1) Definition: Isolated descriptive traditions and cross-linguistic variation have sometimes obscured a typologically unified view of ideophones, but recent advances show the promise of a prototype definition of ideophones as conventionalised depictions in speech, with room for language-specific nuances. 2) Integration: The variable integration of ideophones across linguistic levels reveals an interaction between expressiveness and grammatical integration, and has important implications for how to conceive of dependencies between linguistic systems. 3) Iconicity: Ideophones form a natural laboratory for the study of iconic form-meaning associations in natural languages, and converging evidence from corpus and experimental studies suggests important developmental, evolutionary, and communicative advantages of ideophones.

The syntax of number and modification: An investigation of the Kipsigis DP,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004599/current.pdf?_s=Q_GeHZWN5d2tAmYW,"['Kouneli, Maria']","This dissertation is an in-depth investigation of DP structure in Kipsigis, an extremely understudied Southern Nilotic language spoken in Kenya. All data come from original fieldwork, and the theoretical focus is on the following three broad areas: number morphology, the syntax of adjectives, and the syntax of determiner spreading.


Kipsigis has a tripartite system of number marking: some nouns are morphologically unmarked in the singular and form their plural with a plural suffix, some nouns are unmarked in the plural and form their singular with a singulative suffix, while a third class of nouns always have a singulative suffix in the singular, and a plural suffix in the plural. I argue that this pattern is due to the existence of a noun classification system based on number features on little n, which interact with number features on Num in a way that generates the three types of number marking. My analysis corroborates the existence of number-based noun classification, which has been argued before for Tanoan languages (Harbour 2007). I also show that the Kipsigis morphological number classes are orthogonal to the mass/count distinction in the language, contra Grimm’s (2012; 2018) claims for Nilo-Saharan. Finally, I argue that the term ‘singulative’ is misleading, with at least two types of singulatives cross-linguistically: true allomorphs of singular (e.g., in Kipsigis) or morphemes with a classifier-like function in the syntax (e.g., in Ojibwe).


Adjectives in Kipsigis can only modify a noun as predicates inside a relative clause, despite overwhelming evidence that they constitute a morhosyntactic category distinct from (stative) verbs in the language. The Kipsigis data, thus, provide strong support for Baker’s (2003a) claims that adjectives are a universal lexical category and that direct nominal modification is not their flagship property. They also support a separationist view of adjectival syntax, along the lines of Cinque’s (2010) – among many others – direct vs. indirect modification distinction, and provide clear evidence for the analysis of the latter type of adjectives in terms of a relative clause structure. Kipsigis is also added to a list of languages that completely lack direct modification adjectives, and I briefly discuss why the syntax of direct modification might be unavailable in some languages.


In Kipsigis each adjective or full relative clause that modifies the noun must be preceded by one of four determiners; three of these determiners are demonstratives, making Kipsigis a rare example of a language with demonstrative spreading (as opposed to the common spreading of definite articles; cf. Alexiadou 2014). I argue that the complex distribution of these determiners is best captured by an analysis of relative clauses as D’s with a clausal complement (Kayne 1994 among others), with my analysis of determiner spreading being close to Alexiadou & Wilder’s (1998) analysis of determiner spreading in Greek. I discuss the implications of the Kipsigis data for the typology of determiner spreading (also called definiteness agreement in the literature), and I conclude that a relative clause structure is key to the understanding of the phenomenon, even in languages that are often analyzed in terms of agreement/concord (e.g., many Semitic languages). Finally, I show that demonstratives in Kipsigis are best analyzed as D heads, and conclude that demonstratives can be either heads or phrasal depending on the language.","['determiner spreading', 'adjectives', 'kipsigis', 'nilotic', 'number morphology', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019
Syntactic Ergativity in West Circassian (PhD thesis),https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004600/current.pdf?_s=-KVfhTdrGBClxzmp,"['Ershova, Ksenia']","This dissertation explores the relation between the notion of subjecthood and syntactic ergativity through the lens of West Circassian (or Adyghe; of the Northwest Caucasian family), a polysynthetic morphologically ergative language. West Circassian displays a number of unusual syntactic ergativity effects, i.e. effects which indicate that the absolutive argument occupies the structurally prominent position which is generally believed to be associated with subjecthood. Through the close examination of two such effects – reciprocal binding patterns and constraints on parasitic gap licensing – I arrive at the conclusion that the absolutive argument in West Circassian may be generated in a variety of positions within the verbal theta-domain, but then uniformly undergoes A-movement to the highest argument position in the clause regardless of its theta-role. 
The derived status of the high absolutive explains why a number of subjecthood diagnostics, such as reflexive binding and obligatory control configurations, single out the ergative agent as the subject: this is because the syntactic properties of these constructions rely on the voice projection, which is merged directly above the verbal theta-domain, i.e. vP. Given the low position of Voice0, diagnostics which involve the use of this head single out the highest argument in vP as the subject, rather than the highest argument in the full clause. The proposed analysis provides support for the idea that subjecthood properties may be disbursed across several positions – in a syntactically ergative language like West Circassian, these positions are often occupied by two distinct nominals. In the absence of a single position or single nominal which could be labeled as a subject within a given clause structure, the term ‘subject’ becomes theoretically vacuous. 
The dissertation provides insight into the nature of syntactic ergativity, the structural status of subjecthood, and the syntax of anaphor binding, parasitic gap licensing and obligatory control constructions. Through the examination of argument asymmetries in a polysynthetic language, this project contributes to the line of research demonstrating that polysynthesis and non-configurationality cannot be defined macro-parametrically, but are rather a consequence of several micro-parameters at play, and that there is configurational structure at the core of such a language.","['west circassian', 'polysynthesis', 'ergativity', 'case', 'agreement', 'subjecthood', 'anaphor binding', 'wh-movement', 'parasitic gaps', 'control', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019
The Predictable Case of Faroese [PhD thesis],https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004164/current.pdf?_s=DihLdcaB2DqhXDpn,"['Galbraith, Daniel']","This thesis concerns case-marking phenomena in Icelandic and Faroese. I argue that the best approach to case distinguishes the levels of abstract, morphosyntactic and morphological case, and permits mismatches between levels in some grammars (Linking Theory, Kiparsky 1997, 2001); these mismatches are best handled by an Optimality Theoretic output harmonisation on the mapping from argument structure to morphosyntax (Prince and Smolensky 1993 et seq.). Such a theory provides a cogent account of predicates with non-nominative subjects in Insular Scandinavian, which present an interesting puzzle: in Icelandic, dative-subject verbs occur with nominative objects that trigger number agreement, whereas in Faroese the object in such sentences is marked accusative and occurs with default third person singular agreement. To date this difference has been poorly understood, and calls for in-depth analysis. The central hypothesis explored in this thesis is that the patterns observed are not language-specific idiosyncrasies, but the outcome of constraint interactions of a typical kind: namely, a pressure to index a nominative argument in the clause by number agreement, and a pressure to express structural accusative case on the object. I argue that similar constraint conflicts are responsible for the loss of lexical case in phenomena such as nominative substitution and case non-preservation, and correctly predict the availability of the passive in dative-subject predicates. I include a substantial amount of new data from surveys conducted on the Faroe Islands and Iceland, which are consistent with my hypothesis, and shed new light on the case systems of these languages beyond simple monotransitives. Moreover, I propose a Competing Grammars Model of intra-linguistic variation (cf. Kroch 1989 et seq.), which finds empirical support in corpora, and offers a plausible framework for explaining the diachronic trajectory of these languages. Finally, the model of grammar proposed here is also cross-linguistically tractable, generating realistic typologies of case-related phenomena, and can easily be extended to other language families.","['case', 'syntax', 'morphosyntax', 'ot', 'faroese', 'icelandic', 'linking theory', 'quirky case', 'dative subjects', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019
The interaction of reduplication and segmental mutation: A phonological account,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004090/current.pdf?_s=vft8fq-J19QfgLg-,"['Paschen, Ludger']","This dissertation explores the interaction of reduplication and segmental mutation. Previous studies have shown that both mutation and reduplication can be understood as purely phonological operations in response to defective segmental and prosodic material. Cases of over- and underapplication in reduplicated structures, however, pose a serious challenge to phonological accounts and are apparently better handled by non-modular approaches that invoke morpheme-specific constraints or construction-specific cophonologies. The main goal of this dissertation is to show that a phonological account of over- and underapplication of segmental mutation is not only feasible but that seemingly opaque interactions are in fact predicted by mixed representational-serial approaches. Following the broad research program of Generalized Non-Linear Affixation, and assuming a modular feed-forward architecture of grammar, I demonstrate how apparent cases of overapplication (including ``backcopying'') follow from the interplay of markedness conspiracies, copying of non-minimal prosodic domains, and phonological stratification. Underapplication, on the other hand, emerges from a shortage of mutation triggers, either due to excessive underspecification or as a direct consequence of minimal copying. In addition, I offer reanalyses of purported cases of suppletive allomorphy in reduplication in terms of complex, yet fully transparent segmental phonological alternations. The dissertation thus strengthens the general argument for item-based approaches to non-concatenative morphology and advocates a strictly modular architecture as an alternative to lexical indexation.","['reduplication', 'mutation', 'optimality theory', 'stratal ot', 'opacity', 'overapplication', 'underapplication', 'cyclicity', 'non-linear affixation', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2019
Two paths to polysynthesis: The view from West Circassian nominalizations,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004118/current.pdf?_s=NljsJG152o2nnQwN,"['Ershova, Ksenia']","West Circassian displays prominent polysynthetic morphology both in the verbal and nominal domains and both syntactic categories are subject to the same morphological ordering constraints. I argue that despite these similarities, nominal and verbal wordforms in West Circassian are in fact constructed via two distinct word formation processes: while the verbal root and any accompanying functional morphology are pronounced as a single phonological word by virtue of forming a single complex syntactic head via head movement, the nominal head and its modifiers are pronounced as a single word due to rules of syntax-to-prosody mapping. Such a division of labor provides an account for why only nouns, and not verbs, exhibit productive noun incorporation in the language: West Circassian noun incorporation is prosodic, rather than syntactic. The evidence for the existence of these two avenues of word formation comes from a systematic violation of morpheme ordering observed in verbal nominalizations. In terms of broader theoretical impact, the proposed analysis provides insight into what factors shape a polysynthetic language: while it is tempting to reduce polysynthetic morphology to either simple head movement or just a consequence of mapping complex syntactic structure to a single phonological word without any head movement, the West Circassian data show that neither of these mechanisms can be dispensed of.","['generative syntax', 'minimalism', 'noun incorporation', 'head movement', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019
A Jewel Inlaid: Ergativity and Markedness in Nepali,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005022/current.pdf?_s=LRLQqocQnkQPA6io,"['Lindemann, Luke']","Nepali presents with a complex case marking pattern in which ergative case is obligatory in perfective transitive clauses, disallowed in unaccusative intransitive clauses and copular clauses, and varies with the nominative elsewhere. Where ergative marking is variable, its usage correlates with a variety of semantic and pragmatic factors. The purpose of this investigation is to precisely delineate the grammatical domains for which ergative marking is variable and to provide a unified analysis of the semantic and pragmatic factors that correlate with its expression.

The study of pragmatic phenomena requires the implementation of multiple strategies for collecting language data. The data for this investigation come from four converging lines of inquiry: descriptions of the Nepali pattern in the literature, targeted elicitations with thirteen native speakers, the implementation of a grammaticality judgment survey in Kathmandu in 2016, and the analysis of a published corpus of spoken Nepali.

The analysis found ergative marking to be obligatory in perfective main clauses and variable in subordinate clauses. What appears to be active marking in intransitive clauses is analyzed as ergative marking in transitive clauses with covert objects. The only categorical split is the distinction between perfective and non-perfective verb forms. Every other association was found to be non-categorical.

These non-categorical associations include a positive correlation between subjects with inanimate reference and the expression of ergativity in common nouns, and a
negative correlation between first person pronouns and ergativity in the pronominal domain. This follows expected patterns of marking based on the types which are most frequent in discourse. Ergative marking is somewhat associated with highly individuated objects, but not with affected objects.

Ergative marking is positively associated with characterizing or individual-level predicates, kind readings, categorical propositions, and strong construals of quantifiers. There was no correlation found between ergative marking and agency or volitionality.

The unified analysis of these associations contributes to theories of Optional Ergative Marking and to optional case marking systems in general. The main claim is that the Nepali ergative marks an effector of the event described by the clause. This term refers to a participant which is implicated in enacting and effecting the event, but is not necessarily its main controller or instigator. As a component of the ergative case marking system, it has a pragmatic usage, implicating the subject as a participant in a prototypically transitive event. Aspects of this analysis contribute to the general theory of Optional Ergative Marking and its relation to argument proto-roles. Associations between the ergative and prototypical properties of a transitive event arise from the meaning of the ergative marker as an effector. This analysis also provides a straightforward explanation for the lack of volitional correlations in Nepali that we find in other languages with variable ergativity.

Other semantic and pragmatic features are associated with discourse prominence. These include the correlation with categorical propositions and characterizing predicates. Here the associations are attributable to general principles of semantic markedness. Variable ergativity represents the presence of pragmatic implicatures of various strengths. Gradient markedness oppositions can lead to the conventionalization of these associations into semantic entailments. This is demonstrated for English gender marking, the association between ergative marking and semantic properties of the transitive subject in Nepali, and the association between ergative marking and Nepali perfective verb forms.","['ergativity', 'optional ergative marking', 'differential subject marking', 'optionality', 'pragmatic ergativity', 'proto-roles', 'markedness', 'the animacy hierarchy', 'dependent case', 'nepali', 'indo-aryan', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

In this paper I argue, following Gould (1965; 1987), that this confusion results from the fact that uniformitarianism as originally proposed in geology is not itself a uniform notion, and permits at least four readings. Only some of these readings involve substantive claims rather than methodological imperatives, and only some of these readings are useful for the study of language change. The weakest conclusion to be drawn is that these distinct notions need to be kept apart when invoked by historical linguists.","['uniformitarianism', 'actualism', 'catastrophism', 'language change', 'methodology', 'typology', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2019

Based on crosslinguistic data, we argue against both aspects of the traditional view. First, it incorrectly predicts that V-to-T movement and do-support should not cooccur in a language. And second, it does not capture crosslinguistic generalizations about which inflectional heads are supported by do. We develop an analysis of do-support as the outcome of chain splitting, in which a relation between V and T is successfully established and only later split. The successful formation of a head chain (containing V, T, and possibly other heads) accounts for the fact that languages with V-to-T movement may exhibit do-support, and derives the attested do-insertion positions from independent properties of head chains in a given language.","['do-support', 'head movement', 'lowering', 'danish', '(british) english', 'monnese', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

The aim of this paper is to give some information about Amharic-English code-switching. It addresses different issues in related with Amharic-English code-switching. Amharic is SOV language, whereas English is SVO language. 
Since Ethiopia is a multilingual country, code-switching is obviously known between different language speakers. Especially the educated people is mostly switch a code to English while speaking Amharic. And Amharic is serving as a lingua franca and the working language of the federal government for this multilingual nation-Ethiopia. Therefore, some linguistic issues in Amharic-English code-switching are raised in this paper.
According to Kiranmayi, N.C (2010) code-switching is mixing more than one language by bilinguals or multilinguals in a discourse. Code-switching is existing between two or more bilingual or multilingual speakers. When they are speaking together they may use different languages in alternative way. Someone may code-switches using two different languages (Interlingua) or different dialects of the same language (intralingua) interchangeably in a single communication. 
Code-switching may occur in different linguistic aspects in both conversational functions and structural aspects like to indicate a direct quotation, reported speech, interjection, reiteration, message qualification, referential and idiomatic expressions, content and system morpheme distinction, syntactic categories and frequency of switched segments, universal constraints, etc.

The Romance Person Case Constraint is not about clitic clusters,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004141/current.pdf?_s=Wi_iPk9Dzu6UW1-b,"['Sheehan, Michelle']","This paper provides further evidence that the Person Case Constraint (PCC) in Romance is not limited to clitic clusters. Previously, this has been shown for Spanish (Ormazabal and Romero 2013), but I show that, in Italian, French, and Catalan causatives, a 1st/2nd person direct object is incompatible not only with dative clitics but also with full dative arguments (see also Postal 1989, Bonet 1991). This is different from the manifestation of the PCC in ditransitive contexts where only dative clitics are ruled out. The difference follows, I argue, if ditransitives in these languages have two underlying structures so that a DP introduced by ‘a/à’ can be either dative or locative, in line with broader cross-linguistic patterns (see Harley 2002; Demonte 1995, Cuervo 2003 on Spanish; Anagnostopoulou 2003, Fournier 2010 on French; Holmberg, Sheehan & van der Wal 2018 on Italian). For this reason, indirect object DPs marked with a/à must trigger PCC effects in causatives but not in ditransitives, as only in the former are they unambiguously dative. Further support for this claim comes from Spanish, a language which morphologically distinguishes locative vs. dative phrases in ditransitives via clitic doubling (Cuervo 2003) and which shows PCC effects with all animate direct objects (Ormazabal and Romero 2007, 2013). I show that these facts are compatible with approaches to the PCC based on intervention (Anagnostopoulou 2003, 2005 amongst others), but raise challenges for those which rely crucially on the weak/clitic status of datives (Bianchi 2006, Stegovec 2017).

Coahuilteco exhibits an unusual pattern of subject-object concord, in which internal arguments consistently inflect based on the phi-features of the external argument. This can receive a simple explanation as a case of the sharing of phi-features between subject and object under Agree, provided maximal projections may serve both as probes and goals. I show that this marker is indeed a morpheme which attaches to the object, and argue against a possible alternative in which a mediating functional head in the verbal complex is responsible for the transmission of phi-features from the subject to object. If correct, this analysis has a number of implications for syntactic theory more generally, some of which I highlight.","['syntax', 'agree', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

The existing approaches of ATB make different predictions about the distribution of such reflexes across the conjuncts under long-distance ATB-movement. The data collected from 4 Niger-Congo languages provide evidence for asymmetric extraction from the 1st conjunct + a terminal movement step inside the 2nd conjunct. Furthermore, the observed asymmetry between long and short ATB-movement regarding the distribution of the reflexes (symmetric vs. asymmetric) is derived by the standard relativized minimality condition on syntactic operations, here on upward probing, combined with the assumption that PF-lowering also applies in an ATB-fashion.","['atb-movement', 'locality', 'terminal vs. intermediate movement steps', 'upward probing', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

Issues in Esahie Nominal Morphology: From Inflection to Word-formation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005437/current.pdf?_s=_e_Y_3Cbnj6Yp93C,"['Broohm, Obed Nii']","The present study is a documentation-oriented research which aims at exploring the nominal
morphology of Esahie, an otherwise unexplored cross-border Kwa language. Essentially, it
examines pertinent inflectional and word formation issues in the nominal domain of Esahie
such as noun class system, agreement, syncretism, nominalization, and compounding. The
overall goal of this thesis is to investigate and provide a comprehensive account of the attested
types, structure, formation, and the lexical semantics of nouns and nominalizations in Esahie.
This thesis also seeks to understand what the facts about the structure and formation of nouns
and nominalizations in Esahie reveal about the nature of the interface between morphology,
phonology, syntax, and semantics, and about the architecture of the grammar in general. In
interpreting the Esahie data, we ultimately hope to contribute to current theoretical debates by
presenting empirical arguments in support of an abstractive, rather than a constructive view of
morphology, by arguing that adopting the formalism of Construction Morphology (CxM, see
Booij 2010a-d), as an abstractive model, comes with many advantages. We show that the
formalism espoused in CxM is able to deal adequately with all the inflectional and word
formation issues discussed in this thesis, including the irregular (non-canonical) patterns which
are characterized either by cumulative exponence or extra-compositionality. With regards to
compounding, this study confirms the view (cf. Appah 2013; 2015; Akrofi-Ansah 2012b;
Lawer 2017) that, in Kwa, notwithstanding the word class of the input elements, the output of
a compounding operation is always a nominal. This characterization points to a fascinating
(mutual) interplay between the word-formation phenomena of compounding and
nominalization, since the former operation invariably feeds into the latter. Overall, this thesis
shows that nominalization is a prominent word-formation operation in Kwa grammar. Data
used in this thesis emanates from several fieldtrips carried out in some Esahie speaking
communities in the Western-North region of Ghana, as well as other secondary sources.","['esahie', 'nominal morphology', 'inflection', 'nominalization', 'compounding', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2019

The overall order of slots parallels the order of functional heads in the syntactic structure. However, not every slot corresponds to a distinct syntactic terminal. Some terminals undergo fission (Noyer 1992), giving rise to situations in which a sequence of morphological slots corresponds to a single syntactic terminal. The paper proposes a syntax-morphology mapping for all of the slots in the Algonquian verb inflection template, distinguishing slots that realize distinct syntactic terminals from slots that realize the same terminal via fission. Several criteria that can help to distinguish between these alternatives are suggested.","['inflection', 'templates', 'fission', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019
Eliminating T as an independent syntactic head,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004532/current.pdf?_s=ry_FJ7iTymCykZGY,"['Hosono, Mayumi']","In this paper, I propose to eliminate T as an independent syntactic head from the computational system of human language. Adopting feature inheritance (Chomsky 2013, 2015) and assuming that tense (and other features, if any) is inherited from C by T, T does not have any contents in lexicon. It is doubtful that T can exist as a legitimate syntactic head, though tense feature definitely exists in human language. Based on Hosono’s (2018) analysis on verb movement, I propose that in languages such as French and English, a verbal head moves and merges to the root, and it inherits tense (and any other functional features) after C merges; in V2 languages, a verbal head directly moves to C, and feature inheritance does not occur. In both cases, I argue, the object which has traditionally been called TP is unlabeled. I also introduce the framework of workspace proposed by Chomsky et al. (2017) and Chomsky (2017), who change the definition of the merging operation from Merge to MERGE and claim that only external and internal MERGE are legitimate, rejecting other merging operations, e.g. countercyclic movement such as verb movement. I argue that without T, the problem on the countercyclic property of verb movement is solved.

No name: The Allosemy View,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003154/current.pdf?_s=UzyzyhB1_4nnvV63,"['Saab, Andrés', 'Lo Guercio, Nicolás']","According to certain versions of predicativism, names denote metalinguistic predicates of a certain type, e.g. the name Perón as it occurs in the sentence Perón died in 1974 denotes a predicate more or less paraphrasable as “being called Perón” (Burge 1973, Matushansky 2008 and Fara 2011, among others). The metalinguistic theory of names is claimed to be superior in nontrivial ways to direct reference theories, according to which names contribute an individual without the mediation of descriptions (Kripke 1980). The alleged triumph of predicativism is that by assuming the “being called N” property as basic, both referential and non-referential uses of proper names can be given a uniform semantic analysis. By contrast, the referentialist needs to resort to homonymy or semantic ambiguity. In addition, there are some systematic connections between referential and predicative uses of names that at first glance also seem to favor predicativism. The goal of this paper is to present an alternative syntax, semantics and pragmatics of proper names. We assume that grammatical categories and the associated meanings that they are supposed to encode are not grammatical primitives, but epiphenomena that result from the particular way in which syntax combines functional material and lexical Roots. Before syntax, lexical Roots have no detectable meanings. On this account, there are no names before syntax, as there are no nouns, verbs or adjectives. Names are thus seen as the result of a particular syntactic configuration whose semantic realization is that of contributing an individual. Metalinguistic uses of names, and other derived uses, are involved in a different syntactic scheme, one that makes a name Root a predicate of a certain type. Besides their different syntactic basis, we argue that metalinguistic inferences in both referential and predicative uses of names have a pragmatic source. According to the theory we propose, then, the so-called Being Called Condition is neither a syntactic nor a semantic primitive. Under this conception of proper names the uniformity argument does not hold and the adduced linguistic evidence cannot lead to any (meta-)semantic consideration.

Dissimilation was extended to loanwords having the suffix and has persisted for multiple generations, but is entirely unsupported by the lexicon, which instead displays a phonotactic harmony tendency.

On the limits of variation in West-Germanic verb clusters.

In this context it is remarkable that Swiss German features a verb cluster-like construction with an unmarked 213 order. I will argue that this construction indeed represents a proper verb cluster and not an instance of the 3rd Construction, which also allows the 213 order. Based on new diagnostics, viz., stranding of VP3 under topicalization of the
governing VP2, short relative clause extraposition and displaced zu, I will show that verb clusters and Verb Projection Raising differ from the 3rd Construction with respect to the structural position of the dependent VP: while the dependent VP is contained within the projection of the governing verb in the former, it occurs outside of the projection of the governing verb in the latter. Applying the diagnostics to the Swiss German 213 construction delivers a clear result: the construction patterns with verb
clusters rather than the 3rd Construction. I conclude from this that theories of verb clusters and unmarked word order more generally must be able to generate all six logically possible orders, including the 213 order.","['verb clusters', 'verb projection raising', '3rd construction', 'west-germanic', 'swiss german', 'displaced zu', 'adjunction', 'extraposition', 'post-syntactic morphology', 'local dislocation', 'haplology', 'variation', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

The only cases that may override this ban appear to be abbreviations (BBC, DDR), onomatopoeias (Wauwau), and ideophones (ballaballa).

I present a method that deals with the common problem of varying sub-corpus sizes (I suggest we randomly resample the sub-corpora up to a predefined size), and to the problem of old words appearing as new at the start of the corpus (I suggest we take an earlier corpus and determine a point in time when almost all old words have registered).

The paper also unfolds a perspective on case concord that analyses it as the copying of morphological material rather than the matching of morphological features. These proposals are put to the test in a detailed analysis of the case facts of Estonian, with particular emphasis on the distinction, within its eleven ‘semantic’ cases, between the seven spatial cases (analysed as alternative realisations of a null P) and the last four cases (treated as autonomous realisations of postpositions). This analysis of the Estonian case system has repercussions for the status of genitive case (structural vs inherent), and for the analysis of (the distribution of) case concord. It also prompts a novel, purely syntactic outlook on case distribution in pseudo-partitives, exploiting a key contrast between Agree and the Spec–Head relation: when agreement involves the Spec–Head relation, it is subject to a TOTAL MATCH condition.","['adposition', 'alternative realisation', 'case', 'concord', 'exponence', 'pseudo-partitive', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

The asymmetry states that complex event nominals such as graduate can license ellipsis of its verbal counterpart, but not vice versa. I have argued that this asymmetry can only be accounted for by a morphosyntactic containment condition to the effect that the syntactic structure of an antecedent must properly contain that of an elided constituent. I have further shown that this position receives independent support from Sugimoto’s (2018) recent discovery of a similar asymmetry observed with causative alternation verbs such as break and melt, in which the causative vP structure allows the ellipsis of the inchoative VP structure, but not the other way around. The asymmetry under investigation and the analysis thereof furnish an excellent testing ground in favor of an abstract morphosyntactic derivation for zero-derived noun-verb pairs in contemporary syntactic theory, while retaining the important sights from the level-ordering hypothesis of Kiparsky (1982a, b) within his framework of Lexical Phonology.","['conversion', 'category mismatch', 'vp-ellipsis', 'syntactic identity', 'containment condition', 'lexical phonology', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

International research on bilingualism: Cross-language and cross-cultural perspectives,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004452/current.pdf?_s=fxHzotfIPfc_P0Bk,"['Francis, Norbert']","Linguistics and the science of Anthropology have much in common. In fact, to a large extent the two fields overlap. Field workers utilize research models of the ethnographic type as well as approaches that are experimental, methods that are qualitative as well as quantitative, for example. The study of language contact and bilingualism, topic of this paper, presents a good opportunity for drawing on contributions from the two overlapping fields. The focus of the following review of current research will be mainly from the cognitive science point of view, divided into four areas of recent work: (1) bilingual development, first and second language learning and language loss, (2) creolization and convergence, (3) codeswitching and borrowing, and (4) problems related to the distinction between language and dialect. A guiding concept in better understanding the findings of research in these four areas is the special status of the mother-tongue (child first language). In bilingual communities, children often develop mother-tongue, or native-language level, competence in two languages – the acquisition of two first languages. How is second language learning different, and in what ways will research show that it is similar, or the same? Linguistics in East Asia and in other multilingual regions around the world present us with common research problems in the study of language contact and bilingualism because of notable historical parallels. Some of these parallels can be traced to the movement and settlement of founding populations. The more recent immigration and settlement of newer arriving populations is also comparable in some ways from the point of view of cross-language and cross-cultural interaction. In this regard an especially interesting parallel is that between Taiwan and North and South America. The four sub-topics to be briefly reviewed are closely related. The creation of new languages in creolization and convergence is basically about first and second language learning (#1 and #2 above). Related to the questions in this field, we study codeswitching and borrowing (#3) as an aspect of language contact on different levels: internally between the two mental grammars of the bilingual, and externally in communication with other bilingual individuals. How does this kind of linguistic interaction affect learning, language loss, and possible convergence involving two languages or two dialects? Then, what do we mean when we ask: how is variation from one language to another different from variation within a language? This question (#4) is actually difficult to answer. But it is related to processes of learning and communication between speakers of one language, or dialect, and another. Finally, the comparisons centered on East Asia allow us to study the design features of the most divergent writing systems in use in the world today and how these contrasts might be related to the cross-language interaction issues.

We argue that such overlap must be disallowed as a matter of principle. We present an empirical argument in favour of such a restriction, which is based on the generalisation that comparative markers which occur to the left of the adjectival root are incompatible with suppletion. This generalisation can be shown to follow from a restriction against overlapping derivations. In order to achieve such nonoverlapping derivations, an Unmerge operation may remove previously created structure.","['comparatives', 'suppletion', 'analytic', 'synthetic', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019
Where Do English Sibilant Plurals Come From?,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004427/current.pdf?_s=GE2gYDy-i3H9cExA,"['Emonds, Joseph']","Very early in Middle English, texts especially in the North and East, tend to use an orthographic suffix –(e)s for noun plurals, in Southern and Western texts the plural suffix –(e)n of the Old English weak declension at first spreads, but then by 1300 also yields to –(e)s. This essay first shows that on phonological and phonetic grounds this –(e)s, which remains the productive plural in Modern English, must, as a vocabulary item, be lexically specified as +Voice; it is not voiced by any progressive assimilation process in synchronic derivations. The source of this underlying voiced sibilant –z, completely absent in Old English, is to be found in the genealogical ancestor of Middle English, Proto-Scandinavian, whose plural in all non-neuter declensions is precisely this segment (Haugen 1982). The present essay argues that this form was an integral part of the Norse brought to England by the earliest Scandinavian settlers in the 9th c. In all likelihood, the later change in Mainland Scandinavian of this –z to –r, completed in the 12th c., failed to establish itself in the Anglicized Norse of England, due to sociolinguistic factors akin to those set out in the classic paper of Labov (1963).

Polish adnominal participles accept a wide range of event modifiers except when they are additionally modified by focus or phase particles corresponding to still. The paper argues that the semantic contribution of still is incompatible with the change-of-state component of the meaning of participles. While still presupposes that the property denoted by the participle holds over the initial proper subinterval during which the focalized state holds, the measure-of-change function found in resultative participles entails that the relevant subinterval corresponds to the change of state over which the relevant property does not hold yet. The participles modifiable by still are argued to lack the change-of-state component.","['participles', 'passives', 'degree achievements', 'focus particles', 'adverbials', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2019

First, I propose a specific model of the relationship between lexicon and syntax in human language. This model allows us to use the strategy of correlating the general question of what is natural and what is cultural in language with the nature of the various components that make up a language. Thus, I propose the following correlation: the cultural dimension of language would be expressed essentially in the lexical component of languages, while the biological/natural dimension is expressed in the syntactic component. Such a strategy also makes it possible to better understand why different traditions in contemporary linguistic theory arrive at such different assessments of the role of natural factors in language design.

Restrictions on the Morphosyntactic Marking of Dependencies: What Linkers Tell Us,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000878/current.pdf?_s=TFpyLKTjzsqXoikR,"['Philip, Joy']","This paper proposes a new generalisation concerning the morphosyntactic marking of grammatical dependencies. Important typological work by Nichols (1986) distinguished marking the head of a grammatical relationship (head-marking) from marking of the dependent (dependent-marking). In addition, the relationship between co-heads in an extended projection may also be marked. To these three forms of marking this paper adds a further parameter: the distinction between affixes and independent syntactic words as markers of the relevant relationship. Exploring this parameter leads to a more restrictive theory of marking grammatical dependencies, whereby of the three forms of marking, only dependent-marking is available for independent syntactic words. It is argued that this restriction can be derived from three assumptions: (i) independent syntactic words head a projection in their own right in the syntax; affixes do not; (ii) if the marker of a grammatical relationship heads its own functional projection, it is subject to a structural intervention requirement; (iii) principles of Extended Projection (Grimshaw 2000, 2005). The empirical means of testing the theory is provided by linkers – syntactically independent, semantically vacuous words indicating a relationship between two items. Using data from genetically and geographically diverse languages, it is shown firstly that linkers may be used to mark a variety of head-dependent relationships, but never the relationship between co-heads in an extended projection, and secondly that the linker always marks the dependent: constituency tests from fronting, coordination and deletion, as well as independent morphosyntactic properties, indicate that the linker is invariably attached to the dependent.",['v1 [May 2009]'],2018

"Lexical propensities in phonology: corpus and experimental evidence, grammar, and learning",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004346/current.pdf?_s=vvm_9TThl8Gk9uz_,"['Zymet, Jesse']","Traditional theories of phonological variation propose that morphemes be encoded with descriptors such as [+/- Rule X], to capture which of them participate in a variable process. More recent theories predict that morphemes can have LEXICAL PROPENSITIES: idiosyncratic, gradient rates at which they participate in a process—e.g., [0.7 Rule X]. This dissertation argues that such propensities exist, and that a binary distinction is not rich enough to characterize participation in variable processes. Corpus investigations into Slovenian palatalization and French liaison reveal that individual morphemes pattern across an entire propensity spectrum, and that encoding individual morphemes with gradient status improves model performance. Furthermore, an experimental investigation into French speakers’ intuitions suggests that they internalize word-specific propensities to undergo liaison. The dissertation turns to modeling language learners’ ability to acquire the idiosyncratic behavior of individual attested morphemes while frequency matching to statistical generalizations across the lexicon. A recent model based in Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar (MaxEnt) makes use of general constraints that putatively capture statistical generalizations across the lexicon, as well as lexical constraints governing the behavior of individual words. A series of learning simulations reveals that the approach fails to learn statistical generalizations across the lexicon: lexical constraints are so powerful that the learner comes to acquire the behavior of each attested form using only these constraints, at which point the general constraint is rendered ineffective. A GENERALITY BIAS is therefore attributed to learners, whereby they privilege general constraints over lexical ones. It is argued that MaxEnt fails to represent this property in its current formulation, and that it be replaced with the hierarchical MIXED-EFFECTS LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL (MIXED-EFFECTS MAXENT), which is shown to succeed in learning both a frequency-matching grammar and lexical propensities, by encoding general constraints as fixed effects and lexical constraints as a random effect. The learner treats the grammar and lexicon differently, in that vocabulary effects are subordinated to broad, grammatical effects in the learning process.

Bolivian Aymara restricts the cooccurrence of plain, ejective, and aspirated stops within, but not across, morphemes. We document these restrictions in a morphologically parsed corpus of Aymara. We further present two experiments with native Aymara speakers. In the first experiment, speakers are asked to repeat nonce words that should be interpreted as monomorphemic. Speakers are more accurate at repeating nonce words that respect the nonlocal phonotactic restrictions than nonce words that violate them. In a second experiment, some nonce words are interpetable as morphologically complex, while others suggest a monomorphemic parse. Speakers show a sensitivity to this difference, and repeat the words more accurately when they can be interpreted as having a morpheme boundary between two consonants that tend to not cooccur inside a morpheme. Finally, we develop a computational model that induces nonlocal representations from the baseline grammar. The model posits projections when it notices that certain segments often cooccur when separated by a morpheme boundary. The model generates a full Maximum Entropy phonotactic grammar, which makes distinctions between attested and rare/unattested sequences in a way that aligns with the speaker behavior.

Although the pronominal system in SA includes pronouns declining for person, gender, number and case, morphological syncretism exists where gender is not contrastive in the 1st person pronouns plus the dual pronouns. Moreover, case does not show distinct realizations in the accusative/genitive pronouns. The paper shows that the under-specification of vocabulary items can account for all the pronominal patterns. However, two syntax-independent mechanisms are needed to account for problematic bimorphemic pronouns: Fission (Noyer, 1997) and Impoverishment (Bonet, 1991). In this paper, fission is proposed in a rule-governed format, where a node is split into two nodes: the first node bears the case/person features while the other bears the number/gender features. As for the syncretism in the case of the 3rd person pronouns and in the gender of the dual pronouns, they are accounted for by two contextualized impoverishment rules: the first rule involves the deletion of case features, whereas the other deletes the gender features. Both impoverishment rules are operative in the 3rd person dual pronouns and they occur in a non-restrictive order.","['standard arabic', 'pronouns', 'distributed morphology', 'impoverishment', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

We argue that what is responsible for the special status of wh-subjects is their high structural position.

IO-TSL increases the power of TSL’s tier projection function by making it an input-output strictly local transduction.

The Labeling Algorithm and Kirundi Inversion Structures,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004632/current.pdf?_s=JwC_CbBhZCxx-TTA,"['Selvanathan, Naga']","Moro (2009) proposes that Italian inversion structures provide evidence for one of the predictions of the Labeling algorithm (LA, Chomsky 2013, 2015). This is that in structures in which labeling is ambiguous, one of the constituents must be moved to a higher position, instantiated in Italian inversion as an intermediate focus position. However, Italian provides little independent evidence for movement to such a position and the evidence it does provide is limited to symmetrical structures containing two DPs. In this paper, I argue that Kirundi Object-Verb-Subject (OVS) inversion structures and transitive expletive constructions (TECs) (Ura 1996, Ndayiragije 1999), provide more direct evidence for the type of movement that Moro proposes for Italian. Because of a confluence of Kirundi idiosyncrasies, Kirundi shows unambiguously that when the external argument does not move to Spec, TP, it cannot stay in Spec, vP. Importantly, this ban on remaining in Spec, vP cannot be accounted for by appealing to relativized minimality (Rizzi 1990). Kirundi thus instantiates a key prediction of the LA.

Crucially, it has been argued to display properties that are at odds with the notion of agreement in spoken languages. A thorough theoretical investigation of the phenomenon may thus add to our understanding of the nature and limits of agreement in natural language. Previous analyses of the phenomenon can be divided into three groups: (i) gesture-based non-syntactic analyses, (ii) hybrid solutions combining syntactic and semantic agreement, and (iii) syntactic accounts under which agreement markers are reanalyzed as clitics. As opposed to these accounts, we argue in this paper that sign language agreement does represent an instance of agreement proper, as familiar from spoken language, that is fully governed by syntactic principles. We propose an explicit formal analysis couched within the Minimalist Program that is modality-independent and only involves mechanisms that have been independently proposed for the analysis of agreement in spoken language. Our proposal is able to capture the (apparent) peculiarities of sign language agreement such as the distinction of verb types (only some verbs show agreement), the behavior of backwards verbs (verbs displaying agreement reversal), and the distribution of the agreement auxiliary. However, we suggest that the combination of mechanisms is modality-specific, that is, agreement in sign language, and in German Sign Language in particular, involves modality-independent ingredients, but uses a modality-specific recipe which calls for a (somewhat) unusual combination of independently motivated mechanisms.","['agreement', 'auxiliaries', 'differential object marking', 'ergativity', 'german sign language', 'minimalist program', 'distributed morphology', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

Adopting the view that compositionality is the fundamental organizing property of language, we show first that actions of the hands, face, head, and torso in sign languages directly reflect linguistic components, and illuminate certain aspects of compositional organization among them that are relevant for all languages, signed and spoken.  Studies of emerging sign languages strengthen the approach by showing that the gradual recruitment of bodily articulators for linguistic functions directly maps the way in which a new language increases in complexity and efficiency over time.  While compositional communication is almost exclusively restricted to humans, it is not restricted to language.  In the spontaneous, intense emotional displays of athletes, different emotional states are correlated with actions of particular face and body features and feature groupings.  These findings indicate a much more ancient communicative compositional capacity, and support a paradigm that includes visible body actions in the quest for core linguistic properties and their origins.

We argue that the reduplication takes place when a categoryless root is merged with a null nominal categorizer which copies the phonological matrix of the root. There is a condition on word formation, maybe universal but certainly applying to Chinese, that a content word must consist of at least two constituents. A root merged with a categorizer satisfies this condition. In Xining Chinese the condition on nouns is that they have to consist of minimally two pronounced constituents. When the condition is not independently satisfied, as in a compound or affixed noun, reduplication is how the condition is met. In conjunction with a minimalist theory of word formation, this will be shown to predict the distribution of reduplication in various contexts. For instance, the head of a compound can be reduplicated, but not the modifier, some affixes but not others permit reduplication of the base, non-compositional compounds do not allow any reduplication, and so called ‘bound roots’ (really, bound words) are not reduplicated. The phenomenon provides very strong evidence that simple content words are made up of categoryless root and a categorizer which is often null, but can be overt in some languages, including Xining Chinese.","['root', 'merge', 'compound', 'reduplication', 'chinese', 'bound word', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

In this paper, I focus on a special use of the poss.3sg suffix in Hungarian constructions such as a hülyéje (the stupid-poss.3sg): lit. ‘its stupid’, meaning ‘that total idiot’. My main claim is that this suffix is an affective demonstrative suffix (Lakoff 1974; Liberman 2008; Potts and Schwarz 2010), and that it has developed as a result of grammaticalization from a full-fledged possessive construction of the form a világ hülyéje (the world stupid-poss.3sg): lit. ‘the world’s stupid’, meaning: ‘the biggest idiot in the world’. I will show that this gradual process can be reconstructed fairly accurately using historical and contemporary corpora. I also claim that this grammaticalization pathway is very natural as it is based on a set-element relationship which is often expressed by possessive constructions cross-linguistically. I also identify two parameters which facilitate this grammaticalization process: the availability of (silent) pro possessors and the lack of gender agreement on the possessive suffix. Since Uralic languages in general have these parameters, I will argue that this grammaticalization pathway should at least be considered as one of the possible sources of the demonstrative (and definiteness marking) uses of poss.3sg suffixes in Uralic languages. Finally, my results are also an important contribution to the debate on whether demonstratives can be derived from other functional elements through grammaticalization (Plank 1979; Traugott 1982; Himmelmann 1997).","['possessives', 'demonstratives', 'definitess', 'grammaticalization', 'hungarian', 'uralic', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

This correlation holds despite intralanguage variation in both phenomena. The paper proposes that the two phenomena pattern together because both are determined by the outcome of the Agree operation on Infl. When Infl enters a Multiple Agree relation with both arguments, the realization of portmanteau agreement morphology is possible. When Infl agrees only with the object, it duplicates the result of an earlier object agreement operation on Voice. The presence of identical features on Infl and Voice triggers an impoverishment operation that deletes the features of Voice, resulting in its spellout as an underspecified elsewhere form—which is the exponent that we know descriptively as the inverse marker. This analysis explains why inverse marking and portmanteau agreement never co-occur in Algonquin: the two phenomena are determined by alternative outcomes of the Agree operation on Infl.  The analysis also enables a simple account of the intralanguage variation in the patterning of the two phenomena, which is shown to follow from variation in the specification of the probe on Infl.","['agreement', 'inverse marking', 'equidistance', 'portmanteaux', 'algonquin', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

Pomeranian is the West Germanic language spoken by European emigrants who went from Farther Pomerania (present-day Poland) to Brazil in the period 1857 - 1887. This language is no longer spoken in cohesive societies in Europe, but the language has survived and is in remarkably good shape on this language island in the tropical state of Espirito Santo. This monograph offers the first synchronic grammar of this language. After a historical introduction, the book offers a systematic description of its phonology, morphology, and syntax. The language is contrasted with its European sisters, more particularly High German, Dutch, and Frisian. It highlights various phenomena that will presumably contribute to the ongoing theoretical debate on the Germanic verbal system. It provides new data on cluster V2, do-support, and the two infinitives. As to the infinitival syntax, the language shows remarkable parallels to the system of Frisian. As to the rich Pomeranian system of subtractive morphology, the phonological account that is offered, will be important for the ongoing discussion of the abstractness of phonological representations. Finally, Pomeranian is a welcome addition to the set of languages on which our etymological understanding of West Germanic is based.","['pomeranian', 'west germanic', 'language islands', 'weak t', 'subtractive morphology', 'historical grammar', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2018
THE OVS CONSTRUCTION,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004194/current.pdf?_s=lFpLbBpmrFCjHPJN,"['Titov, Elena']","This paper offers an in-depth analysis of the Russian OVS construction in an attempt to account for the parametric variation in the availability of OVS cross-linguistically. It is argued that the Russian OVS construction is base-generated and is employed in order to encode the relative information-structural prominence of arguments. It is proposed that, cross-linguistically, syntactic encoding of information- structural prominence relations via neutral scrambling is available exclusively to languages that are capable of encoding thematic prominence relations of arguments at PF. Conversely, languages that lack PF encoding of thematic prominence are obliged to syntactically represent this prominence relation, which results in the unavailability of syntactic encoding of information-structural prominence. A consequence of this is that when information-structural and thematic prominence relations misalign, only one of them can be syntactically represented. An interpretive relation that fails to be syntactically encoded must be made visible at PF.","['syntax', 'prosody', 'morphology', 'information structure', 'scrambling']",2018
In support of an OT-DM model: Evidence from a morphological conspiracy in Degema,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003746/current.pdf?_s=RFds3XKz5RvPRJBW,"['Rolle, Nicholas']","This paper provides support for a modified DM model which I call Optimality Theoretic Distributed Morphology (OT-DM). The strongest form of this model is that all morphological operations take place in parallel, which I call the Morphology-in-Parallel Hypothesis (MPH). Although combining OT and DM is unorthodox in practice, I show that a growing body of data warrants his modification (Trommer 2001a, 2001b, 2002; Dawson in press; Foley to appear; a.o.), and provide evidence for OT-DM from a morphological conspiracy involving verbal clitics in Degema (Nigeria). To account for this conspiracy, I argue that agreement clitics are inserted post-syntactically via the DM operation Dissociated Node Insertion (DNI), and further that verb complexes are formed post-syntactically via the operation Local Dislocation (LD). I argue that both these operations are triggered by a well-formedness markedness constraint which requires verbs to appear in properly inflected words on the surface. These DM operations are decomposed into a series of constraints which are crucially ranked. Candidates are freely generated from GEN and are subject to all DM operations, and are evaluated via EVAL against the ranked constraint set. I illustrate that under standard views of DM in which DNI proceeds VI, a serial model results in an ordering paradox, and that even after parameterizing DM operation ordering in response, this model does not adequately account for the morphological conspiracy.

Second, these Zapotec varieties do not allow certain combinations of identical third-person clitics, which we will call a *X–X Constraint.

From my perspective, Pater’s (2018) target article does a great service to both researchers who work in generative linguistics and researchers who utilize neural networks – and especially to researchers who might find themselves wanting to do both by harnessing the insights of each tradition. The fusion of theories of linguistic representation and probabilistic learning techniques has certainly led to many interesting and valuable insights about the nature of both linguistic representation and the language acquisition process. However, I feel that the most exciting aspect of Pater’s article is the increasing interpretability of neural network models, especially when combined with insights from the generative linguistics theoretical framework. This allows for the possibility that neural networks could be used to actually generate new theories of representation. I describe how I think this theory generation process might work with interpretable neural networks.","['generative linguistics', 'neural networks', 'probabilistic learning', 'language acquisition', 'theory generation', 'bayesian inference', 'learnability', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2018

We show that this pattern cannot be captured by a tier-based strictly local (TSL) language. This is problematic for the weak subregular hypothesis, which claims that all segmental phonological stringsets are TSL languages. Next, we consider an alternative phonological analysis that is compatible with a TSL representation, but empirically unsupported. Finally, we consider the possibility that Uyghur backness harmony might be a lexicalized pattern, and find some suggestive evidence in support of this. This alternative appears to be the most likely way in which Uyghur backness harmony might, in principle, turn out to be compatible with the hypothesis that TSL languages provide an upper bound on phonological learnability.","['uyghur', 'vowel harmony', 'backness harmony', 'subregular hierarchy', 'subregular hypothesis', 'formal complexity', 'phonology', 'tsl', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2018

Prosodically-driven morpheme non-realization in the Minorcan Catalan DP,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004171/current.pdf?_s=1gyWV6xqImVfxMrh,"['Pons-Moll, Clàudia', 'Torres-Tamarit, Francesc']","This paper focuses on a case of prosodically-driven morpheme non-realization found in Minorcan Catalan kinship restrictive appositional phrases, in which the personal article en is realized before masculine personal names starting with a consonant, but not before masculine personal names starting with a vowel, or before feminine personal names starting in either a vowel or a consonant. From a strictly syllabic point of view, this pattern is unexpected, since a preconsonantal coda is generated in the former cases, and an onset-less syllable and a hiatus are generated in the second. Following work by Selkirk (2001), we propose that this asymmetric behavior is mainly driven by the constraint ALIGN(PWd, L; Lex), according to which the left edge of the prosodic word must be aligned with a lexical category. We show that, whereas it is possible to satisfy this constraint without challenging basic syllabification constraints (i.e. *C.V, ONSET) when the personal name starts with a consonant, this is not possible when the personal name starts with a vowel. The effects of the alignment constraint are inhibited by the need to realize phonologically the morph corresponding to a morpheme when the information it carries is not recoverable, and this explains the realization of the personal article in isolated constructions. The interaction of ALIGN(PWd, L; Lex) with standard right-alignment requirements, finally, accounts for the lack of realization of the feminine personal article before feminine personal names in these appositional phrases. The data taken into consideration and the subsequent formal analysis allow us to explore the nature and the typology of morpheme realization constraints, and to assess the theoretical consequences for the phonology-morphosyntax interface and for the architecture of grammar.","['personal article', 'morpheme non-realization', 'recoverability', 'morphosyntax-prosody interface', 'alignment', 'catalan', 'optimality theory', 'morphology', 'phonology', 'syntax']",2018
"Prepositional Repercussions in Russian: Pronouns, Comparatives and Ellipsis",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004016/current.pdf?_s=9eQ224OLDxIgC26z,"['Philippova, Tatiana']","The dissertation deals with Russian morphosyntactic phenomena involving adpositions. Much of it is devoted to a study of the distribution of the so-called pripredložnye ‘adprepositional’ pronouns in Russian. Their seemingly chaotic distribution proved to be hard to account for. Especially puzzling was the fact that beyond the P-object environments these pronouns, ‘n-forms’, appear only in the genitive standard DP of the Russian phrasal comparative, in which no preposition appears. 

I propose a uniform analysis of the distribution of n-forms in Russian, which maintains the intuition that they are ‘adprepositional’, i.e. occur in P-object positions. However, I refine the generalization by saying that n-forms are only licensed in the complement of P-heads. I thus make a crucial distinction between a vaguely defined group of prepositions and lexemes that are syntactically P-heads. Only those ‘prepositions’ that are P-heads license n-forms in their complement. 


I examine a large group of ‘prepositions’ in detail, arguing that only some of them are P-heads. The ‘comparative puzzle’ is solved by proposing that the phrasal comparative in Russian involves a null P-head that licenses the genitive n-form in the standard DP. Lexemes labelled prepositions in traditional grammars of Russian are proposed to split into three classes. Class I lexemes are P-heads, the only ‘true’ prepositions in a sense. Class II lexemes are structurally ambiguous between N-heads or P-N combinations (the complement being an argument of the nominal head), and a lexicalized P-head composed of syntactically inactive N- and P-elements. Class III lexemes are never P-heads: they are P-N combinations, transitive adverbs (A-heads) or gerunds (V-heads). 


The arguments for treating ‘prepositions’ of Class III as non-prepositions, and lexemes of Class II as ambiguous between prepositions and nouns or prepositional phrases are theoretically quite neutral and may be adopted to explain n-form distribution in various linguistic frameworks, making this thesis potentially relevant to a wide audience of readers. However, maintaining the same analysis to derive n-forms in the phrasal comparative while avoiding the claim that synthetic comparatives are actually prepositions (P-heads) is more demanding: it requires an abstract theoretical framework that allows syntactically active but phonetically null elements of various categories, here P-heads. The existence of independent evidence for the null P analysis of the phrasal comparative and the explanatory power of the resulting uniform treatment of n-forms justify this abstract construct, suggesting that this kind of approach may well be on the right track. 


This part of the dissertation has implications for the typology and morphosyntax of pronouns, and typology and theory of case. It may also be instructive for further studies aimed at classifying adpositions in various languages. In addition, the classification of ‘prepositions’ developed here may prove relevant for understanding the non-homogeneous behavior of different prepositions in specific constructions. 


The remaining part of this dissertation delves more deeply into the syntax of the Russian phrasal comparative, the structure behind the genitive standard of comparison. I show that the standard DP and the DP it is contrasted with belong in the same clause. This favors the simple, Direct Analysis of the standard DP, under which it does not involve additional (silent) structure. Next, I offer a new generalization, the Oblique Correlate Constraint, which imposes morphosyntactic restrictions on the genitive standard DP. I show that the constraint quite straightforwardly falls out from a more complex, Reduced Clause Analysis, positing abstract structure behind the standard. Looking at other languages, I suggest that the presence of such a constraint in their phrasal comparative may signal that they are to be analyzed as reduced clauses. This study adds to the growing body of literature on the structure of phrasal comparatives across languages and contributes to the notorious debate on whether standard of comparison in phrasal comparatives is to be analyzed as a simple DP or as a reduced clause.","['russian', 'adpositions', 'prepositions', 'pronouns', 'case', 'comparatives', 'ellipsis', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

On prominence scale interactions in Hayu: a Harmonic Grammar account,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004213/current.pdf?_s=gVFf0AAGVoHM9p5r,"['Georgi, Doreen']","This paper investigates the complex verbal agreement system in Hayu (Kiranti). In most scenarios, the subject and the object of a transitive verb compete for cross-referencing on the verb. The ""winner"" is determined by the interaction of two prominence scales. Interestingly, these scales need to be ranked in order to produce the correct output in cases of conflicting preferences. Moreover, in one particular context, it seems as if the ranking of the scales has to be reversed. This agreement pattern poses a challenge to existing analyses of scale-driven agreement. I propose a Harmonic Grammar-based analysis where an argument's prominence is quantified by a numerical value: the more salient on a prominence scale, the higher the numerical value of an argument. The values of different scales are added to produce the harmony score for each of the arguments. The agreement rule in Hayu then turns out to be very simple: the agreement controller is the argument that has the highest harmony score. In this system, the ""exceptional"" scenario falls out automatically as a cumulative effect; neither complex constraints nor (reversed) scale rankings are necessary.

Nominal-clitic case mismatches,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004250/current.pdf?_s=xNN5bf25u9qLF_qx,"['Tyler, Matthew', 'Yuan, Michelle']","When arguments are clitic-doubled, the clitic and the nominal it doubles typically bear the same case feature. However, recent theoretical work on clitic-doubling, including but not limited to so-called 'Big DP' analyses (e.g. Uriagereka 1995, Nevins 2011, Kramer 2014) treats clitics and nominals as separable entities in the syntactic derivation. Given this background, we propose that under the right syntactic conditions, nominals and their clitics should be able to mismatch in case features. In particular, we identify and investigate two classes of mismatch, which form the mirror image of each other. In Choctaw (Muskogean), nominals acquire case features that their associated clitics lack, while in Yimas (Lower-Sepik; data from Foley 1991), clitics acquire case features that their associated nomals lack. We argue that these mismatches are the consequence of case-assignment operations that target nominals or clitics individually.

The availability of such targeted case-assignment operations is contingent on the language creating the right syntactic configurations. In Choctaw, nominals may be individually targeted for a round of NOM/ACC case-assignment because clitics are doubled at a low position on the clausal spine: by the time that NOM/ACC case is assigned at TP, clitics have already separated from their nominal associates. And in Yimas, clitics may be individually targeted for a round of ERG/ABS case-assignment because they adjoin to the same functional head: following Yuan (2017), multiple clitics adjoined to the same head may employ case-assignment as a dissimilation strategy.","['clitic-doubling', 'clitics', 'case', 'alignment', 'dependent case', 'syntax', 'morphology']",2018

We take this complementarity to be an indirect argument in favour of (i) divorcing argument licensing from argument selection and (ii) dissociating argument introduction from event-structure-related heads, which then potentially reaffirms the role of roots in (first phase) syntax.","['compounding', 'argument selection', 'argument licensing', 'roots', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

In Barcelona Catalan, the effects of this constraint are inhibited by an anti-alignment constraint prohibiting the right edge of a foot from coinciding with the right edge of a clitic. In Mallorca and Menorca Catalan, stress shift is also understood as a strategy to meet the unmarked nominal
stress pattern of Catalan, although in these dialects the anti-alignment constraint is also undominated, leading to catalexis, in this case a melodically empty mora, and thus to final stress.","['catalan', 'clitics', 'stress', 'stress shift', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2018

In this paper, it is argued that an initial templatic site is responsible for the length variation of the prefixes. Under specific licensing conditions, the initial site hosts the causative and the reciprocal prefixes by means of two distinct operations, namely movement and spreading. Moreover, complex combinations of those prefixes (causative + reciprocal, reciprocal + causative) feed apparently unrelated phenomena of selective harmony and dissimilation. They are argued to follow directly from the use of the initial site as part of the verb domain. Handled in syntactic structure, the initial site further allows accounting for the cooccurrence restrictions that the causative and the imperfective markers undergo: it is proposed that the causative takes precedence over the imperfective because it is generated lower in the structure under the vP. The same reasoning holds for the incompatibility of imperfective gemination with the reciprocal marker.

Across the domains of (1) word meanings, (2) morphologically inflected words, (3) n-grams, (4) sentence-level constructions and (5) phonetics and phonology, accounts based on independently-represented abstractions (whether formal rules or prototype categories) fail for two reasons. First, it is not possible to posit abstractions that delineate possible and impossible forms; e.g., that (a) rule in pool tables and data tables, but rule out chairs, (b) rule in “mist” and rule out “missid” as the phonological form of the past tense of miss, (c) rule in both John feared Bill and John frightened Bill but rule out *John laughed Bill. Second, for each domain, empirical data provide evidence of exemplar storage that cannot be captured by putative abstractions: e.g. speakers prefer and/or show an advantage for (1) exemplar variation even within word-meaning “category boundaries”, (2) novel inflected forms that are similar to existing exemplars, (3) n-grams that have occurred frequently in the input, (4) SVO sentences with he as SUBJECT and it as OBJECT and (5) repeated productions of “the same” word that are phonologically similar or, better still, identical. An exemplar account avoids an intractable lumping-or-splitting dilemma facing abstraction-based accounts and provides a unitary explanation of language acquisition across all domains; one that is consistent with models and empirical findings from the neuroimaging literature.","['child language acquisition', 'exemplar account', 'instance-based', 'memory-based', 'word meaning', 'syntax', 'morphology', 'phonology', 'n-grams', 'construction', 'abstraction', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2018

Structural Sources of Anaphora and Sameness (Ph.D. thesis),https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004154/current.pdf?_s=VTNr_EICLWG-gNoH,"['Hanink, Emily']","Definite descriptions may give rise to anaphoric interpretations. Addressing this, work in the field of semantics has led to syntactic claims that anaphora-encoding indices are syntactically represented in the DP (i.a. Elbourne 2005; Schwarz 2009). An open question is, however, how these indices interact syntactically with another type of anaphoric element within the DP: modifiers. An example of one such modifier is ‘same’, which readily participates in anaphora cross-linguistically. 

In this dissertation, I address this interaction by investigating the morphosyntactic properties of anaphoric DPs both with and without ‘same’. Rejecting the null hypothesis that same is simply a modifier that appears in an otherwise unchanged DP syntax, I argue that, while anaphoric definite descriptions do in fact house indices in their structure, anaphora with ‘same’ arises from a different source: ‘same’ is a degree head that encodes anaphora by selecting an index of its own -- a common trait of degree elements more generally. This proposal leads to testable predictions, which I show to be borne out with data from German and from fieldwork on Washo, a Native American isolate.

Crucial to the treatment of same as a degree head is an account of its use in introducing ‘as’-relatives. I argue that while the degree head ‘same’ selects for an index on its anaphoric use, an ‘as’-relative may occupy the same structural position in cases of clausal modification, obviating the need for an antecedent. I give an analysis of as-relatives assuming a matching structure of relative clauses, and further relate this type of embedded clause to restrictive relatives introduced by ‘same’.

Finally, the claim that ‘same’ is a degree head rather than an adjective raises pertinent questions about the nature of inflection. The dissertation therefore addresses problems posed by German for current accounts of nominal concord, which are posed by degree modifiers of various types. I argue for a post-syntactic account along the lines of Norris (2014), for whom inflection is achieved by the insertion of Agr nodes onto individual heads post-syntactically, but argue instead that Agr is inserted phrasally, at DegP, which I show to account for a wide range of inflectional patterns.

In sum, the dissertation addresses three core topics, concerning: i) the way anaphoric interpretations arise from distinct structural sources, both within and across languages; ii) the relationship between individuals and degree expressions; and iii)  the nature of attributive degree modification.

This is indicated by a number of syntactic tests which group DOM objects with morphologically zero-coded direct objects, rather than with indirect objects, including nominalisation, relativisation, controlling secondary predicates, and passivisation. I suggest that languages with a ditransitive alternation between direct/indirect and primary/secondary objects provide further support for the syntactic difference of DOM and dative objects.

This, it is claimed, offers an explanatory account of basic word order patterns in BP. External argument DPs, merged above V, are closer to T than V, meaning that they must raise to satisfy the EPP, predicting SV(O) order with transitive and unergative predicates, including transitive psych-predicates. Internal arguments are merged below V, however, and so with unaccusatives, it is movement of the verb bearing a [uD] feature which satisfies the EPP, giving rise to VS order. With copular verbs which take small clause complements, a similar affect holds, as the copular verb can satisfy the EPP. Verb movement can also satisfy the EPP in impersonal contexts, hence the fact that BP lacks overt expletives.","['epp', 'subject requirement', 'verb movement', 'basic word order', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

Possessors and external arguments (EA) of nouns that have them give rise to [XP, YP] configurations, which are problematical for labeling under Chomsky's assumptions. 

But in languages with grammatical gender, N/n differ from the clausal counterparts V/v in having intrinsic phi-features. My paper claims that gender concord between n and a possessor or EA labels nP via shared features, enabling these arguments to surface nP-internally. Bantu languages (among others) show this feature-sharing clearly in the form of overt concord on the morpheme 'of' that introduces a lexical argument. 

In contrast, possessors in a number of genderless languages, including Turkish and Yup’ik, must raise to permit labeling of nP, and surface in a high functional category whose head can agree with them in the DP-internal counterpart to subject agreement (Abney 1987). 

The paper contributes to an ongoing debate regarding the mechanics of concord and its place in the grammar: is it a consequence of Agree in the syntax, or a distinct, perhaps post-syntactic process? Assuming that it feeds the labeling algorithm and bleeds DP-internal possessor agreement and possessor raising, I argue that gender-number concord are part of narrow syntax and the outcome of Agree.

When Phi-Agreement Targets Topics: The view from San Martín Peras Mixtec,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004066/current.pdf?_s=vKi7r41bCZj3udgB,"['Ostrove, Jason']","This dissertation presents what is, to my knowledge, the first in-depth theoretical syntactic investigation of a Mixtec language: San Martín Peras Mixtec. The syntax of this language is explored through the lens of a process called pronoun doubling, which duplicates the phi-features of a nominal with a preverbal morpheme that is morphophonologically identical to a regular pronoun.


The narrow question of this dissertation is what the synchronic analysis of pronoun doubling is.  Ultimately, I argue that, despite initial appearances, the ``pronoun'' in pronoun doubling constructions is not a true pronominal, but rather the morphophonological exponent of a phi-agreement process that targets topics. 

But as this process replicates $\varphi$-features, I consider two possibilities. First, I investigate if pronoun doubling could be a form of clitic doubling. I argue that clitic doubling is best derived by phrasal movement of the doubled nominal, followed by reduction of the higher copy to a clitic. Therefore, in order to diagnose clitic doubling within this ``Move-and-Reduce'' framework, we must look for evidence of movement in pronoun doubling constructions. 

I first consider A-movement. I describe a novel A-movement process which I term ``quantifier fronting.'' I then show that none of the A-movement properties of quantifier fronting can be found in pronoun doubling. I also show that A-movement in SMP Mixtec is typologically unusual in being much less restricted than A'-movement.

A'-movement in SMP Mixtec shows several interesting properties. First, it demonstrates an A'-extraction restriction reminiscent of syntactic ergativity: external arguments may not undergo A'-movement. I investigate this restriction through the properties of two A'-constructions. I first investigate restrictive relative clauses, which require a resumption strategy in order to avoid the ban against extraction of external arguments. I then investigate content wh-questions, which avoid this ban by employing a movement construction that demonstrably lacks the properties of both A-movement and A'-movement. Crucially, no evidence for this extraction restriction is replicated in pronoun doubling constructions. 

As clitic doubling within this Move-and-Reduce framework does not seem like a viable option, I consider the possibility that pronoun doubling is a form of phi-agreement. Despite appearances, this turns out to be the best fit for several reasons. First, pronoun doubling obeys the PIC yet allows Closest Conjunct Agreement. Second, pronoun doubling yield novel variable-binding possibilities. That said, pronoun doubling is not vanilla phi-agreement for two reasons. First, both subjects and objects are equally accessible, depending on which is interpreted as a topic.


To account for this system, I develop a theory in which phi-agreement can target topics. This functions similarly to a traditional minimalist Case theory, in which nouns must stand in an Agree relation with some functional head in order to receive Case. I adapt this general approach to topic agreement by proposing that nominals which are to be interpreted as topics must stand in an Agree relation with a head Top, and Top also acts as a phi-probe.

The dissertation is organized as follows. Chapter 1 provides the necessary background on this language, including a brief syntactic and phonological overview. Chapter 1 also provides a detailed discussion of the prosodic conditions which restrict the appearance of topic agreement. Chapter 2 provides an extensive literature review of both phi-agreement and clitic doubling, including an exhaustive evaluation of the diagnostics which have been put forward to distinguish the two. In this chapter I also argue for why clitic doubling is best understood within a Move-and-Reduce framework. This approach to clitic doubling allows for intuitive argumentation for either clitic doubling or phi-agreement: clitic doubling constructions show the characteristics of movement chains, while phi-agreement does not.

With this background, Chapter 3 begins the investigation of movement constructions in San Martín Peras Mixtec by investigating A-movement. It begins with a detailed discussion of the syntax of embedded clauses. This is because failure to extract from finite embedded clauses is a common feature of A-movement cross-linguistically. In this language, though, it is difficult to tell which embedded clauses are finite because there is no non-finite verbal morphology and all embedded clauses have an overt subject. I argue that, despite appearances, this language distinguishes between Obligatory Control and simple pronominal coreference, despite this language's equivalent of PRO always being overt. This relation is mediated through a CP layer, which faithfully tracks when Obligatory Control occurs.

Once these aspects of the clause structure have been established, I demonstrate the A-movement properties of quantifier fronting, such as failure to reconstruct for scope or binding, and the ability to expand the variable and anaphora binding possibilities within a clause. I also show that A-movement in this language is much less restricted than A'-movement, despite being clause bounded. While A'-movement forbids extraction of possessors, objects of prepositions, and, as shown in Chapter 4, external arguments, A-movement shows no such restriction. Additionally, A'-movement, particular content wh-questions, require pied-piping with inversion, while A-movement is incompatible with it. Importantly for our purposes, pronoun doubling fails to show any of these A-chain properties: it fails to affect variable or anaphora binding, and it may not target objects of prepositions or possessors.

As pronoun doubling fails to show the properties of an A-chain, Chapter 4 considers the possibility that the movement chain involves is an A'-chain. This requires an extensive investigation of A'-movement in this language. I demonstrate that San Martín Peras Mixtec shows a strict A'-extraction restriction, in addition to the restictions shown in Chapter 3: external arguments may not undergo A'-extraction. This restriction, while similar in many ways, is fundamentally different from syntactic ergativity for two reasons. First, San Martín Peras Mixtec is not morphologically ergative. Second, intransitive predicates show varying behavior, with unergative subjects patterns with transitive subjects while unaccusative subjects pattern with transitive objects. 

After this extraction restiction is established, I demonstrate its properties in more detail. First I investigate restrictive relative clauses, which require resumption of external arguments. I show that this resumption strategy fails to show any properties of movement. This allows the language to straightforwardly avoid the A'-extraction restriction. Second, I investigate the syntax of content wh-questions. These also show the effects of the A'-extraction restriction, albeit the repair is different. Content wh-questions of external arguments do involve movement, but I demonstrate that this movement process fails to show the hallmark characteristics of either A-movement or A'-movement. This also allows the language to satisfy the restriction against A'-extraction of external arguments. I conclude by demonstrating that this extraction restriction that is so crucial to understanding A'-constructions in this language is not replicable in pronoun doubling constructions because external arguments may be freely targeted.

As pronoun doubling fails to show the diagnostic movement chain properties of clitic doubling, Chapter 5 considers the possibility that this process is a phi-agreement. After cataloging the phi-agreement properties of pronoun doubling, such as observance of the PIC, Closest Conjunct Agreement, and the failure to affect variable and anaphora binding, I develop a theory of topic agreement. First, I demonstrate that topic agreement is not an especially rare phenomenon cross-linguistically, having been reported in a range of languages from Northern Khanty (Uralic, Russia), Oromo (Cushitic, Ethiopia), and many others. While the semantic investigation is cursory, I demonstrate that topichood is the best notion to determine which nominals will be targeted in pronoun doubling constructions. Finally, I present the formal analysis of topic agreement, which I described above.","['topic agreement', 'mixtec', 'agreement', 'clitic doubling', 'movement', 'syntax', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

Agreement by Projection is a recent proposal in Hansson (2014) coming out of the Agreement by Correspondence literature, which states that constraints can enforce agreement of a feature across a ‘projection’ of segments. The central innovation of this paper is that I extend this notion of ‘projection’ to sets of outputs (e.g. outputs of a paradigm) over which agreement is enforced (e.g. with respect to root shape, word shape, etc.). I illustrate the OO-Corr via ABP model for different types of output-to-output similarity, including paradigmatic and transparadigmatic OO-Corr types involving networks of output forms.

We investigate basic properties of Locative Shift in ASL: the phenomenon extends to temporal and modal shift; indexical loci are not usually locative-shifted; Locative Shift may have interpretive consequences, some of which appear to be at-issue; and Locative Shift can occur in highly iconic cases, possibly even without prior establishment of a situation-denoting locus. We further investigate the behavior of the co-opted loci under predicate ellipsis.  The individual component of a locative-shifted locus can be bound, and in some cases its locative specification can be disregarded in the elided clause, under conditions that are reminiscent of the behavior of phi-features. In other cases, locative specifications are preserved under ellipsis, possibly even with elided indexical pronouns, whose overt counterparts resist Locative Shift.

forced to resort to ad hoc stipulations to account for the same facts. 
Both derivational (e.g. Kiparsky 1982) and transderivational (e.g. Benua

In this paper I show that the key to such an account lies with the proper understanding of the contribution of the morphological pieces of these items – the numeral, much/little, and the

From this we can not only obtain truth conditions that straightforwardly capture just the right bounding entailments for each item, but we can also naturally derive scalar and domain alternatives that yield just the desired scalar implicature, ignorance implicature, and

Whither Head Movement?,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003960/current.pdf?_s=kY7cRHvZBB20389u,"['Harizanov, Boris', 'Gribanova, Vera']","We argue that head movement, as an operation that builds head-adjunction structures in the syntax, has been used to model two empirically distinct classes of phenomena. One class has to do with displacement of heads (fully formed morphological words) to higher syntactic positions, and includes phenomena like verb second and verb initiality. The other class has to do with the construction of complex morphological words and is involved in various types of word formation. Based on the very different clusters of properties associated with these two classes of phenomena, we argue that they each should be accounted for by distinct grammatical operations, applying in distinct modules of the grammar, rather than by the one traditional syntactic head movement operation. We propose that the operation responsible for upward displacement of heads is genuine syntactic movement (Internal Merge) and has the properties of syntactic phrasal movement, including the ability to affect word order, the potential to give rise to interpretive effects, and the locality associated with Internal Merge. On the other hand, word formation is the result of postsyntactic amalgamation, realized as either Lowering (Embick and Noyer, 2001) or its upward counterpart, Raising. This operation, we argue, has properties that are not associated with narrow syntax: it is morphologically driven, it results in word formation, it does not exhibit interpretive effects, and it has stricter locality conditions (the Head Movement Constraint). The result is a view of head movement that not only accounts for the empirical differences between the two classes of head movement phenomena, but also lays to rest numerous perennial theoretical problems that have heretofore been associated with the syntactic head adjunction view of head movement. In addition, the framework developed here yields interesting new predictions with respect to the expected typology of head movement patterns.","['head movement', 'postsyntactic movement', 'amalgamation', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

However, amongst participants who remained unaware of the agreement pattern there was a significant difference in recall of verb inflections and case markers during the exposure phase task – recall was more accurate in the (attested) language with matching case and agreement alignment than the (nonattested) language in which case and agreement alignment were unmatched.

It divides the mapping procedure into two parts, a cross-linguistically invariant initial mapping, which feeds cross-linguistically variable pruning operations enforcing phonological well-formedness.  A few assumptions concerning the interaction between the initial mapping and syntactic phase structure, combined with a very simple prosodic-structure building algorithm, give us generalisations about the link between prosody and syntax which must otherwise be stipulated. In particular, we recover the fact that lexical categories appear to be visible to prosodic processes but functional categories do not, and the fact that head-directionality in syntax tends to correlate with the location of phrasal edges in phonology. It is also shown that the model in question produces recursive structures in response to certain kinds of syntactic movement, and it is argued that recursive constituents in Irish and Chimwiini exemplify this phenomenon.  Because the mapping between syntax and prosody has a cross-linguistically invariant, deterministic component, this model offers a possible way of using prosodic structure as a precision tool to probe syntactic structure.","['prosodification', 'pruning', 'phonology-syntax interface', 'gyalsumdo', 'tibetan', 'irish', 'chimwiini', '', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2018

Reducing pro and PRO to a single source,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003560/current.pdf?_s=Q1qOwGFfZD6zMMms,"['McFadden, Thomas', 'Sundaresan, Sandhya']","Whenever two otherwise similar grammatical elements display distinct properties and appear in distinct environments, we have in principle two analytic possibilities. One is to posit that they are indeed two underlying elements with inherently distinct properties, which then lead to them having different distributions (Inherent view). The other is to posit a single underlying element with a broad distribution, with the grammatical distinctions arising from the different contexts in which that element appears (Derived view). The goal of this paper is to provide novel theoretical and empirical evidence supporting a version of the Derived view for pro vs. PRO. In particular, we will argue that OC PRO and pro are just labels for different manifestations of what is underlyingly a single underspecified nominal pro-form, which we will call UPro. Included under this UPro will also be the various types of ‘non-obligatory control’ (NOC) PRO, including arbitrary pro (pro_arb). The interpretive and distributional distinctions lurking behind these labels will be seen to derive from how UPro interacts with its structural environment and language-specific rules of morpho-phonological realization. Specifically, OC PRO labels a rather specific interpretation that arises in embedding contexts where a syntactic OC relationship with an antecedent can be established. Different types of pro and NOC PRO, on the other hand, involve ‘control’ by (typically) silent representations of discourse-contextual elements in the clausal left periphery. Finally, pro_arb arguably involves the failure to establish a referential dependence, which we will formalize in terms of a failure to Agree in the sense of Preminger (2014). The crucial evidence that motivates the Derived approach proposed here will be adduced from the “Finiteness pro-drop Generalisation” from Sundaresan (2014): ""For (at least a non-trivial set of) pro-drop languages with subject-verb agreement, pro-drop is disallowed in the subject position of a prototypically non-finite clause.""","['pro(-drop)', 'oc pro', '(non-)obligatory control', 'agree', 'locality', 'finiteness', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018
A note on misplaced or wrongly attached zu ‘to’ in German.,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003980/current.pdf?_s=8dipVXqjWk4dUYa2,"['Schallert, Oliver']","This paper deals with the phenomenon of misplaced zu ‘to’ in German (with a side view of other Continental West Germanic varieties). While this phenomenon only occurs in certain configurations in the standard language, it is common in the dialects and shows quite a high degree of variability. Even though some attention has been devoted to this unexpected property of zu, previous accounts don’t seem to consider or acknowledge the full range of structural types. Beside misplacings due to processes like “upper field formation” (cf. Bech 1955) or verb raising, the infinitival marker can also be detached to the left and even be doubled in certain contexts. I discuss two parsimonious options of how these as well as the “regular” cases can be analyzed, namely (a) precedence rules and (b) a special kind of infixing operation that was first proposed in the framework of Categorial Morphology (Bach 1984, Hoeksema 1985). I will show that even though the first approach has its merits (and might be worth pursuing in other theoretical contexts), the second one is more advantageous. The paper concludes with some remarks on the short-term diachrony of this construction.

Templatic morphology as an emergent property: Roots and functional heads in Hebrew,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003103/current.pdf?_s=uwF5LkIzviiLU-V9,"['Kastner, Itamar']","Modern Hebrew exhibits a non-concatenative morphology of consonantal ""roots"" and melodic ""templates"" that is typical of Semitic languages. Even though this kind of non-concatenative morphology is well known, it is only partly understood. In particular, theories differ in what counts as a morpheme: the root, the template, both, or neither. Accordingly, theories differ as to what representations learners must posit and what processes generate the eventual surface forms. In this paper I present a theory of morphology and allomorphy that combines lexical roots with syntactic functional heads, improving on previous analysis of root-and-pattern morphology. Verbal templates are here argued to emerge from the combination of syntactic elements, constrained by the general phonology of the language, rather than from some inherent difference between Semitic morphology and that of other languages. This way of generating morphological structure fleshes out a theory of morphophonological alternations that are non-adjacent on the surface but are local underlyingly; with these tools it is possible to identify where lexical exceptionality shows its effects and how it is reined in by the grammar. The Semitic root is thus analogous to lexical roots in other languages, storing idiosyncratic phonological and semantic information but obeying the syntactic structure in which it is embedded.","['allomorphy', 'hebrew', 'roots', 'templatic morphology', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2018

Unifying EPP and comp-trace effects: constraints on silent elements at the edge,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003428/current.pdf?_s=mhpbi0Ux4Js14_1h,"['McFadden, Thomas', 'Sundaresan, Sandhya']","In this paper, we focus on the original empirical domain of the EPP, the requirement that certain subject positions be filled, and argue that characterizing it in terms of a syntactic movement-triggering feature is misguided. Specifically, we will argue that, contrary to what is standardly assumed, the factors conditioning the EPP are actually not syntactic, but phonological, as has also been proposed by others in the literature. Nonetheless, the operations that it seems to trigger clearly are syntactic. This sheds light on why the EPP has been so difficult to get a handle on, but it also presents a conundrum, as it seems to suggest that aspects of the syntactic derivation depend on phonological information. 

Under the  broadly Minimalist framework we adopt here, this would be clearly countercyclic. In the standard Y-model and its descendants, the output of the (narrow) syntactic derivation feeds into the interpretive components of PF and LF, thus while syntactic information feeds into PF, phonological information is not available to the syntax. More recent phase-based and multiple Spell-out models introduce a certain amount of feedback, such that syntactic cycles may be interleaved with non-syntactic ones, but it is normally not assumed that phonological information from previous cycles can actually interact with later syntactic cycles. Indeed, the crucial point here is not specific to the Y-model. Rather, it extends to any framework which assumes that the syntactic derivation does not have access to the phonological properties of the structures it manipulates, e.g. as a general principle of modularity or because phonological content is explicitly inserted at a late stage of the derivation after the narrow syntax has done its work. The EPP thus seems to involve a violation of modularity or counter-cyclicity. A novel approach to the EPP is thus required, which must simultaneously be able to handle its unique properties but must also be made to fit in with the broader theory of grammatical architecture. 

We will argue that such an approach will not only allow a more satisfactory account of the EPP itself, but can also yield a unification with the comp-trace effect and yield insight into how both of these interact with pro-drop. This paper is intended as an initial contribution in this direction.

I discuss two such extensions, one making use of pointers (Caha & Pantcheva 2012), and another in terms of a revision of the Superset Principle (based on Caha2014). I show that both approaches make subtly different empirical predictions. Most notably, the approach in terms of pointers is able to derive certain ABA-syncretisms. This consideration favors the approach in terms of the revised Superset Principle. On the other hand, the revised Superset Principle faces an empirical problem in the derivation of horizontal (cross-number) syncretism, which requires the introduction of a principle to determine a winner between candidates that are in a tie with respect to the Elsewhere Principle.","['nanosyntax', 'pronouns', 'aba', 'person', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018
Stochastic phonological knowledge and word formation in Japanese,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003422/current.pdf?_s=UrnVMOP_pd3XIvES,"['Kumagai, Gakuji', 'Kawahara, Shigeto']","The question of whether linguistic knowledge is binary or stochastic is one of the most important questions in general linguistic inquiry. Much recent work in the last few decades shows that phonological knowledge is stochastic (e.g. Hayes & Londe 2006). Building on this body of research, we show that in Japanese, gradient phonological knowledge affects several word formation patterns in stochastic ways. Concretely, we show that identity avoidance effects hold at both the segmental and the CV-moraic levels. These identity avoidance effects stochastically affect two types of word formation patterns in Japanese: group name formation and rendaku. We show that Maximum Entropy Grammar (Goldwater & Johnson 2003), together with multiple OCP constraints (Coetzee & Pater 2008), successfully models both of the observed morphological word formation patterns, without any further stipulation. In addition to this theoretical contribution, one of the patterns discussed in this paper—group name formation—has not been analyzed from the perspective of formal phonological theories before, and hence this paper has descriptive novelty as well.","['japanese', 'word formation', 'maximum entropy grammar', 'multiple ocp constraints', 'stochastic phonology', 'rendaku', 'identity avoidance', 'ocp-nasal', 'sonority', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2018

Building verbs in Chuj: Consequences for the nature of roots,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003565/current.pdf?_s=ycQfC_itBHILfLby,"['Coon, Jessica']","This paper offers an in-depth look at roots and verb stem morphology in Chuj (Mayan)

information is contributed by the root, and what is contributed by the functional heads? I
show first that roots in Chuj are not acategorical, but must be grouped into classes based
on their stem-forming possibilities. Root category does not map directly to surface lexical
category, but does determine which functional heads (i.e. valence morphology) may merge
with the root. Second, I show that while the introduction of the external argument, along
with clausal licensing and agreement generally, are all governed by higher functional
heads, the presence or absence of an internal argument is dictated by the root. Specifically,
I show that transitive roots in Chuj always combine with an internal argument, whether
it be (i) a full DP, (ii) a bare pseudo-incorporated NP, or (iii) an implicit object in an
antipassive. This work contributes to the discussion of how valence morphology operates:
in the spirit of works such as Alexiadou, Anagnostopoulou & Sch¨afer 2006, I argue that
valence morphology applies directly to roots, rather than to some “inherent valence” of a

Using French as a case study, this paper argues that all gender features—even those which have been seen as arbitrary—are necessarily interpretable at the LF interface. Even if a feature does not contribute compositionally to the meaning of a structure, it must be visible to provide the context for interpretation. This leads to an argument for the abandonment of the interpretable-uninterpretable distinction in the representation of features. Instead, the analysis contends that the mechanism of interpretation is responsible for differences in the semantic contribution of features: both heads and sub-structures can be taken as input to the interpretive mechanism. The interpretation of heads leads to compositional meaning, and the interpretation of sub-structures to non-compositional meaning. The system has the consequence of simplifying restrictions on gender specification such that they are solely linked to the availability of a semantic interpretation, rather than to a combination of phonological and semantic licensing conditions.","['interpretability', 'gender', 'feature speci\x0ccation', 'french', 'licensing conditions', 'features', 'distributed morphology', 'compositionality', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2018

It is shown that the distribution of this schwa-like vowel is better analysed within a strict CV model where ungoverned empty vocalic positions surface at the phonetic level. In the same vein, it is proposed that the Classical Arabic short [u] is kept in Moroccan Arabic as a labial feature when it occurs in the vicinity of a labial, velar or uvular consonant. Sibilant harmony is another feature that Moroccan Arabic shares with Amazigh. It is analysed as a long distance process which occurs within a specific domain, consisting of the stem template, plus an empty initial CV. This empty site allows for the Moroccan Arabic definite article and the Amazigh causative prefix to harmonize with the stem sibilant. The influence of Amazigh on Moroccan Arabic is also visible at the morphological level.

After discussing categorial identity through these perspectives, this work first traces the origins and manifestations of Identity Avoidance in language and other domains of human cognition, with emphasis on attention orienting. Second, it proposes a new processing principle, the Novel Information Bias, that (i) captures linguistic Identity Avoidance based on how the brain decodes types and tokens and (ii) explains the universal fact that generally the existence of adjacent occurrences of syntactically and/or phonologically identical tokens is severely constrained.","['attention', 'categories', 'label', 'repetition avoidance/blindness', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2018

"Licensing D in Classifier Languages and ""Numeral Blocking""",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004266/current.pdf?_s=lTNYHgYd7aZeC0Hq,"['Hall, David']","Since Cheng and Sybesma (1999), there has been much discussion of how the interaction of functional heads in the extended nominal projection in numeral classifier languages gives rise to a definite interpretation. An important observation that came out of this discussion is that there appears to be some kind of interaction between a classifier head (call it Cl) and definiteness, where either Cl and D interact through head movement (Simpson 2005), or the Cl head itself introduces an iota-operator. Cheng and Sybesma note that in Cantonese, which exhibits bare Cl-N sequences with a definite interpretation, the addition of a numeral has the effect of ""undoing the definiteness"". The standard approach to accounting for this blocking of definiteness is that of Simpson (2005), where it is suggested that for a definite interpretation to arise in classifier languages, the Cl head has to move to D (in the spirit of Longobardi 1994). The blocking of a definite interpretation in Cantonese is the result of a Head Movement Constraint violation; Cl cannot move to D over the numeral. I show that this numeral blocking effect extends to other languages too, and I argue based on data from those languages that a Head Movement Constraint-based account of definiteness in classifier languages cannot capture the facts, and that we require an alternative. I put forward a proposal which has the consequence that the classifier and numeral form a constituent to the exclusion of the noun, and then discuss some suggestive evidence in favour of such a structural configuration.

I derive the observed distributional differences between languages from the range of values available for the interpretation of this component. In particular, whether a relation of identity falls within the range of values has consequences for whether a suffixal determiner triggers existence presupposition, which, in turn, has consequences both for the interpretation of the DP in question and for the inter-paradigm competition in a language.","['specificity', 'presupposition', 'suffixal determiners', 'finno-ugric', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2017

Other varieties of verbal duplication, such as non-local doublings in Rioplatense Spanish and Italian, and local doublings in European Portuguese, are instead the direct result of verbal copy pronunciation arising from complex factors involving the structure of remnant movement and the general conditions that regulate copy pronunciation in syntax and morphology.

This pattern impacts on morphology (dual featurally crosscuts singular and plural), morphosemantics (number features are sensitive to order of composition), and syntax and its interfaces (the features are interpreted and pronounced where they are merged).

In this paper, we diverge from this trend, claiming that the two approaches suffer from a lack of empirical adequacy. As an alternative, we propose an analysis within the theory of Optimality Theory, with the basic assumption being that the linearization of the causative morpheme is instead the result of phonological well-formedness interacting with the morphological process of causativization. An important empirical prediction of our analysis is that the causative affix can neither move to word-initial positions nor word-final positions under the pressure of phonological well-formedness constraints. This is shown to be an example of the Emergence of the Unmarked, wherein the otherwise inactive markedness constraint *COMPLEXONSET in the language bears the burden of the explanation. The strength of the analysis suggested herein resides in the treatment of the infixal process as resulting from simple and universal constraints, primarily achieved through well-motivated demands on prosodic well-formedness without reference to language-particular templatic constraints.","['optimality theory', 'reduplication', 'syllable structure', 'gemination', 'moroccan arabic', 'prosodic morphology', 'nonconcatenative morphology', 'and morphological causatives', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2017

It contends that, though the noun class system of Esahie per se is morpho-syntactically vestigial, hence differing from other African languages (e.g. most Bantu languages) where noun classes can be assimilated with GENDER, in Esahie, NUMBER, as a syntactic feature, triggers agreement, rendering the class system in Esahie a number-based one. On morpho-syntactic grounds, six distinctive noun form classes are established for Esahie. 

This paper also provides an account of how morpho-phonological information influences the noun form classes of Esahie. As argued for Akan (cf. Bodomo and Marfo 2006), morpho-phonological information is equally relevant for understanding the choice of one number affix over the other in Esahie. The present work presents yet another piece of evidence in support of the view (cf. Ameka and Dakubu 2008, Aboh and Essegbey 2010, and Güldemann and Fiedler 2017) that unlike the Ghana-TogoMountain languages, which have been attested to have a functional class system, the Central-Tano languages, to which Esahie pertains, have a relatively fairly decayed and less-conservative inflectional system.

This thesis focuses on four known points of cross-linguistic variation in the verbal domain: tense, aspect, finiteness and the perfect. It uses data primarily from the Dravidian language Malayalam to explore these questions.
Past work on tense and aspect in Dravidian languages (Amritavalli & Jayaseelan 2005) has claimed that Malayalam, along with the other Dravidian languages, is tenseless. This dissertation, however, shows that Malayalam is empirically different from other tenseless languages and that it does have morphology that encodes tense semantics and a TP. It further examines what have previously been called the two ‘imperfectives’ and argues that the first one is a type of progressive. The second form, is shown to be something between an interative and an imperfective. While the dissertation argues that Malayalam, has tense morphology and a TP, it argues that Malayalam lacks perfect morphology and a PerfP in, minimally, Universal perfects.
The investigation of finiteness focuses on the empirical facts regarding the different non-finite forms in Malayalam and the theoretical implications of these facts. It points out a problem for classifying negation as ‘finite’ versus ‘non-finite’, as has frequently been done (Amritavalli & Jayaseelan 2005, a.o.) and argues that non- finite uses of the -uka marker are progressive participles, that Conjunctive Participles are best analyzed as Stump (1985)-style absolutives and that -athu gerunds involve nominalization above the TP-level (cf.

In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed taxonomy identifies rhyme and ablaut reduplication as the only productive, truly reduplicative processes in the morphology of German. All other contemplable cases of reduplicative structures are properly treated as either phonological doubling, lexical sequencing or (special cases of) compounding. An OT analysis is offered which suggests that both rhyme and ablaut reduplication may emerge when a segmentally and prosodically unspecified expressive morpheme is attached to a base - given that the base strictly obeys certain word prosodic requirements.
The present approach eschews constraints that make explicit reference to base-reduplicant correspondence. The OT grammar successfully models the emergence of the fixed bipedal structure, the obligatory segmental deviance of the reduplicant, non-exponence of the expressive morpheme in the case of non-trochaic bases, the variable linearization of base and reduplicant in ablaut reduplication, and the interaction of reduplication with i) segmental alternations and ii) onset complexity.

	Section 3 addresses the contest between cyclicity and output-output correspondence, focusing on Steriade’s (1999) claim that English dual-level affixes like _-able_ challenge Cyclic Containment. I argue that, whilst Steriade’s argument draws force from important empirical facts, containment-compliant analyses centred on lexical acquisition not only describe the phenomena accurately, but also generate correct empirical predictions that are not matched by accounts relying on output-output correspondence.

	Section 4 assesses Stratal Phonology by evaluating the plausibility of its implications for morphology. I show, first, that the theory can derive the relative ordering of phonological strata without recourse to the Affix Ordering Generalization, and that it can handle bracketing paradoxes without recourse to rebracketing operations. At the same time, Stratal Phonology presupposes that morphology and phonology are distinct grammatical modules, and for this reason it favours concatenativist approaches to putative instances of process morphology, in line with Generalized Nonlinear Affixation.

Following Saab & Liptak (2016), I argue that this difference in inflection is due to NP ellipsis, which creates a 'stranded' affix that subsequently docks onto the determiner. Assuming that adjectives are re-attached by Local Dislocation allows us to account for the descriptive observation that the determiner and pronominal paradigms differ only in the same three exceptional cases where determiners do not bear overt inflection. Furthermore, I discuss how this approach can extend to similar data from Afrikaans, Dutch and English, as well as to split topicalization constructions in German. This analysis provides further support for Saab & Liptak's proposal that inflection emerges as a direct result of ellipsis, rather than constituting part of the licensing conditions on ellipsis (Lobeck 1995).","['np ellipsis', 'morphology', 'strong inflection', 'german', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

Since VoiceP is spelled out with non-active morphology in those languages if it does not introduce an external argument itself, the result is a surface mismatch between morphological form and syntactic function. This proposal predicts that only certain non-finite forms of deponents will surface with the syntax/morphology-mismatch, namely those that include VoiceP. Nominalizations
without VoiceP will appear to suspend the voice mismatch. These predictions are shown to be correct with respect to the behavior of deponent participles in the languages under study.

Evidentiality and Questions: Bangla at the Interfaces,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003695/current.pdf?_s=dluIeNTQEzRp5tfT,"['Bhadra, Diti']","This dissertation has two central foci: (i) it examines the behavioral contrasts of perspective-sensitive elements such as evidentials in questions and assertions; (ii) it investigates the connection between alternative questions and the clausal disjunction-embedder 'whether'. The overall theme of the dissertation is an exploration into the interaction of questions and doxastic domains, set within formal syntactic, semantic and pragmatic theories. The main empirical focus is the South Asian (Indo Aryan; India, Bangladesh) language Bangla (also known as Bengali), which is analyzed based on the native speaker judgements of the author, as well as several surveys collected from other native speakers. 

The interaction of perspectival elements with speech acts have been a relatively under-explored area of study. I undertake the study of evidentials (elements marking an agent's source of information). I argue for a theory that is both syntax and semantics informed. In particular, I propose that evidentials crucially take only finite clauses as complements, and derive their interpretation from a `judge' that is syntactically represented in the left periphery, and that interacts with other perspectival heads both inside the finite clause as well as the speech-act projection. This approach enables a unified analysis of the Bangla evidential 'naki', that changes its evidential flavor based on its syntactic position. In the interpretative component, I argue that evidentials embody either Involved (committed) or Uninvolved (not committed) sources of information. I propose that the world's evidentials come in two shapes: those that effect Interrogative Flip (shifting of perspective from the speaker to addressee in questions) and those that do not, and I locate the difference in a formal semantic property. This formal property predicts the presence or absence of bias in questions with evidentials, and forges a cross-linguistic link between evidentiality and bias.

The second focus of the dissertation is alternative questions and disjunction. The main claim offered is that there is a crucial connection between interrogative and 'whether' in Bangla: they are underlying the same element 'kina'. The surface differences between the two constructions is shown to be derivable from the syntactic processes of head movement and ellipsis. This unification claim has not been undertaken for any other language in the literature. I argue that this claim is also semantically viable, and propose an Alternative Semantics-theoretic analysis that can explain the presence of 'kina' (`whether') in Bangla alternative questions. This analysis, while focussed on Bangla, also makes predictions in an area that is understudied in the world's languages - the interrogative-boolean divide within the universal disjunction space. I undertake a comparative study with Mandarin Chinese, and investigate the locus of the divide in the two languages. Bangla is a language that does not display focus intervention effects in alternative questions and does not allow disjunctive subjects with interrogative disjunction. I demonstrate that these disparate properties can be explained with the main proposal. In addition, I explore split questions in Bangla and show how disjunctive subjects can be hosted by split questions. This study fits into the overall theme of the dissertation by furthering the understanding of Bangla questions and their interaction with other domains such as disjunction and perspective-sensitivity, as viewed from the standpoint of the syntax-semantics-pragmatic interfaces.","['evidentiality', 'alternative questions', 'polar questions', 'syntax-semantics interface', 'perspective-sensitivity', 'disjunction', 'questions', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

A study of 'man'-pronouns in Germanic,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002802/current.pdf?_s=muGlTh5XrlPEAEEt,"['Fenger, Paula']","This paper focuses on overt impersonal pronouns such as English 'one' and Dutch 'men' in eight Germanic languages (English, Frisian, Icelandic, Danish, Dutch, German, Norwegian and Swedish). Cinque (1988), Egerland (2003), a.o, assumed that there are two types of impersonal pronouns, one type that can occur in multiple syntactic positions but can only have a generic reading and a type that can have generic and existential readings but can only occur as an external argument. I show based on novel data from ECM constructions and passives and unaccusatives, that it is not the syntactic position which restricts the distribution of men-type pronouns, but it is case. English type pronouns can occur with multiple cases, but can only have a generic inclusive reading. All Dutch type pronouns can only occur with nominative case and can have multiple impersonal readings. Moreover, I show that Dutch and Swedish allow an existential reading when the pronoun is a derived subject (contra Cinque (1988), Egerland (2003)) I will account for this correlation between the different readings and case by assuming different feature make-ups for the pronouns, following Egerland (2003), Hoekstra (2010), Ackema and Neeleman (2016): 'one' has phi features and therefore always needs to be obligatorily inclusive; 'men' lacks this functional layer too and therefore has no restriction on its readings. Moreover, I propose that since men lacks a phi-layer, it is too deficient to project a KP, and therefore it can only occur with unmarked nominative case.","['impersonal pronouns', 'case', 'deficiency', 'germanic', 'generic and existential readings', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

Copying and Resolution in South Slavic and South Bantu Conjunct Agreement,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003589/current.pdf?_s=xLLdpYi5X_OtgYdR,"['Nevins, Andrew']","The purpose of this paper is to develop a theory of resolution of gender values in conjunct agreement, ultimately couched in a theory of copying and nondistinctness. Ideally, as the resolution mechanism is implemented in terms of an agreement mechanism initiated within the &P, it should draw on tools of feature-based computation found elsewhere in the grammar. However, &P-internal agreement is unique within the grammar in that the two participating goals (namely, each conjunct) are equidistant from the &P head in question (assuming it is specified as needing to probe twice). As a result, existing mechanisms such as Multiple Agree (Hiraiwa, 2001, Anagnostopoulou, 2005), which are based on one goal being hierarchically higher than the other, and employed in accounts such as the Person-Case Constraint, are inapplicable. Instead, the closest grammatical parallels to an agreement mechanism with equidistant goals are found in phonology, and it will be proposed that precisely such a mechanism is shared in these two domains, even though they instantiate distinct modules of the grammar. As such, the analysis offered in this paper instantiates a case of Crossmodular Structural Parallelism, a hypothesis about the reuse of operations such as featural agreement, featural deletion, and feature co-occurrence constraints across domains of morphosyntactic and phonological features, and one that has been a fruitful part of linguistic theory throughout the work of Andrea Calabrese (e.g. Calabrese 1998) and many works inspired by it.","['conjunct agreement', 'slavic', 'default vs resolution', 'bantu', 'concord/index', 'crossmodular structural parallelism', 'animacy/humanness', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

The evidence comes from suspended affixation of case markers in alternative questions in Digor and Iron Ossetic. The current literature on alternative questions (e.g. Does Mary like coffee or tea?) proposes that in many languages they are derived by disjunction of and ellipsis in constituents as large as a vP or even as a CP. Language-specific evidence in favor of such structure of alternative questions is available for Ossetic as well. Accordingly, the ostensible disjuncts coffee or tea do not actually form a constituent and case must be separately assigned to each of the DPs. Therefore, a case suffix shared under suspended affixation cannot attach to the orP as a whole. A deletion-based analysis can successfully derive the properties of suspended affixation in Ossetic alternative questions. I advance a specific proposal that incorporates ellipsis into the Distributed Morphology derivation.","['syntax', 'morphology', 'ellipsis', 'suspended affixation', 'ossetic', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017
"Proximate DP, obviative KP: Balancing the morphosyntax and pragmatics of obviation",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004526/current.pdf?_s=FIyM_10GYrPUipNO,"['Oxford, Will']","Obviation is a well-known feature of the Algonquian languages, but in the theoretical literature there is no consensus regarding its nature. This paper proposes a theoretical approach to obviation that is intended to capture not only its morphosyntactic properties but also the crucial role that discourse factors play in its patterning. The analysis combines two existing ideas: Richards’ (2010) proposal that proximate nominals are DP while obviatives are KP and Branigan and MacKenzie’s (1999) proposal that the reference of proximate nominals is controlled by an operator in CP. The main proposal is that the Algonquian clause includes an operator in CP that binds all DPs in its domain unless a KP layer intervenes. There are thus two kinds of third-person nominals in Algonquian: proximate nominals, as DPs, are obligatorily coreferent with the CP operator, while obviative nominals, as KPs, have independent reference. By connecting the DP-KP distinction to the CP level, we gain a unified account of the pragmatics and morphosyntax of obviation: the discourse-governed properties reflect the choice of referent for the topic operator in CP, the morphosyntactic properties follow from the DP-KP asymmetry, and the link between discourse and morphosyntax lies in the referential properties of the nominals: if a nominal is coreferent with the CP operator, it must have DP morphosyntax; if it is disjoint, it must have KP morphosyntax.","['obviation', 'coreference', 'nominal features', 'algonquian', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017
How (not) to derive a *ABA: The case of Blansitt’s generalisation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003782/current.pdf?_s=9vpBczIgn3Pf-bzy,"['Caha, Pavel']","In this paper, I provide an account for the so-called Blansitt’s generalisation (Blansitt 1988). The generalisation says that in the linear sequence DATIVE—ALLATIVE—LOCATIVE, only adjacent functions may be marked the same. In previous work (Bobaljik 2012; Starke 2009; Caha 2009), analogous *ABA patterns have been encoded by the so-called feature cumulation. Feature cumulation means that the amount of features characteristic for individual categories monotonically grows in the order given in any such sequence. However, Blansitt observes that in the case of datives, allatives and locatives, the allative (which is in the middle) tends to be composed of the dative and the locative, so the account based on cumulation does not work. The present paper thus argues for a different representation of the underlying categories, namely as containing (abstractly) the features A, AB and B respectively (following in part Bobaljik & Sauerland 2017). I refer to this as the “overlapping” decomposition. When such a decomposition is combined with the Superset Principle (Starke 2009), it yields both the *ABA restriction and the observed syncretism and containment patterns. I further argue that this is a non-trivial result, since traditional underspecification approaches face significant challenges in deriving the *ABA pattern on the basis of the overlapping decomposition.","['*aba', 'blansitt’s generalisation', 'linear contiguity', 'nanosyntax', 'spatial case', 'syncretism', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017
"Lexical Accent in Cupeño, Hittite, and Indo-European",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003675/current.pdf?_s=XcIz1jlRa9H-BRvu,"['Yates, Anthony']","This dissertation develops optimality-theoretic analyses of word-level stress assignment in
two languages with lexical accent, Cupeño (Takic, Uto-Aztecan) and Hittite (Anatolian, Indo-
European); it also assesses the implications of word stress in Hittite and the other Anatolian
languages for the reconstruction of stress assignment in Proto-Indo-European.

I argue that stress assignment in Cupeño is governed by the BASIC ACCENTUATION PRINCIPLE (BAP; Kiparsky and Halle 1977): stress is assigned to the leftmost lexically accented morpheme, else to the word’s left edge. This analysis is compared to that of Alderete (1999, 2001), who argues that Cupeño shows accentual root faithfulness — i.e., that the accentual properties of roots are privileged over non-root morphemes. I show that the BAP analysis is both simpler and attains greater empirical coverage than the root faithfulness analysis, which fails to account for certain attested stress patterns that are captured under the BAP analysis. Thus reanalyzed, Cupeño has two important typological implications. First, without support from Cupeño, root faithfulness may be unattested as a feature of lexical accent systems. Second, Cupeño provides a clear typological parallel for the ancient IE languages on the basis of which the BAP was posited — in particular, Vedic Sanskrit — as well as for Hittite, where I argue that it is also operative. 

The analysis of Hittite stress advanced in this dissertation is the first systematic attempt at a synchronic generative treatment of its word stress patterns. Having established that stress
assignment in Hittite inflection is governed by the BAP, I also adduce evidence for accentual
dominance — i.e., morphemes whose accentual specification “overrides” the BAP. I propose that accentual dominance in Hittite is a consequence of morphological headedness: the lexical
accent of the word’s head morpheme is privileged in Hittite, just as Revithiadou (1999) has
argued for other lexical accent systems.

Finally, this dissertation addresses the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word-prosodic system. Hittite and the other Anatolian languages are not traditionally viewed as important sources for the reconstruction of this system; however, I contend that the BAP is reconstructible for PIE and that — against this traditional view — this reconstruction depends
crucially on the Anatolian evidence, which converges with Vedic Sanskrit in this respect.","['indo-european', 'uto-aztecan', 'word prosody', 'historical linguistics', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2017
Case decomposition meets dependent-case theories,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003421/current.pdf?_s=5qfHwfT9PDeOqR4r,"[""Zompi', Stanislao""]","In this (slightly revised version of my) MA thesis, I try to lay out a comprehensive survey of *ABA effects in case morphology, with an emphasis on case syncretism, case-based wholesale suppletion, and case-based stem-formative allomorphy. All three of these phenomena, I claim, are universally constrained by the following generalization:  No Vocabulary-Insertion rule can apply both to an unmarked core-case (nominative or absolutive) and to an inherent case (dative, instrumental, locative, etc.) without also applying to a dependent core-case (ergative or accusative).


This generalization traces back to work by Baerman et al. (2005) and Caha (2009) on syncretism, by McFadden (2014) on stem allomorphy, and by Smith et al. (2016) on suppletion. However, most of these works, albeit largely consistent with each other, invoke some or other distinctive qualification or supplementation to the general pattern. Here I argue, in contrast, that such divergences are not empirically warranted, and that the match between the patterns of the three phenomena is indeed perfect or nearly so. This argument rests, most notably, on a critique of Caha’s (2009) proposals concerning several other supposed *ABA universals in syncretisms with or among inherent cases. 

Next, drawing again on Caha (2009), I interpret the *ABA patterns referenced above as evidence for a containment hierarchy [[[UNMARKED] DEPENDENT] INHERENT]. I then observe that the lightest cases in this containment hierarchy, i.e. nominative and absolutive, are also the same cases that are given “elsewhere” status in Marantz’ (1991) configurational theory of case assignment. This suggests that there may be a structural economy principle at work, whereby additional case layers such as those of dependent and inherent cases may only be deployed when the lighter unmarked cases are, in a sense to be made precise, “not enough.”","['*aba', 'dependent case', 'syncretism', 'suppletion', 'case hierarchy', 'distinctness', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017
"Indo-European Reduplication: Synchrony, Diachrony, and Theory",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003685/current.pdf?_s=OwDLoXCc5OalWlCW,"['Zukoff, Sam']","The reduplicative systems of the ancient Indo-European languages are characterized by an unusual alternation in the shape of the reduplicant. The related languages Ancient Greek, Gothic, and Sanskrit share the property that root-initial consonant clusters exhibit different reduplicant shapes, depending on their featural composition. Moreover, even though the core featural distinction largely overlaps across the languages, the actual patterns which instantiate that distinction are themselves distinct across the languages. For roots beginning in stop-sonorant clusters (TRVX– roots), each of these languages agrees in displaying a prefixal CV reduplicant, where the consonant corresponds to the root-initial stop: TV-TRVX–. These three languages likewise agree that roots beginning in
sibilant-stop clusters (STVX– roots) show some pattern other than the one exhibited by TRVX– roots. However, each of the three languages exhibits a distinct alternative pattern: V-STVX– in the case of Ancient Greek, STV-STVX– in the case of Gothic, TV-STVX– in the case of Sanskrit.

This dissertation provides an integrated synchronic and diachronic theoretical account of the morphophonological properties of verbal reduplication in the ancient Indo-European languages, with its central focus being to explain this core alternation between TRVX– roots and STVX– roots. Set within Base-Reduplicant Correspondence Theory, a framework for analyzing reduplication in Optimality Theory, the comprehensive synchronic analyses constructed in service of understanding
this distinction and other interrelated distinctions allow us to probe complex theoretical questions regarding the constraints and constraint interactions involved in the determination of reduplicant shape.

This dissertation seeks not only to develop in depth, consistent accounts of both the productive and marginal/archaic morphophonological aspects of reduplication in the Indo-European languages, it aims to understand the origins of these patterns—from a historical and comparative perspective,
and from the perspective of morphophonological learning and grammar change — and attempts to motivate the conditions for the onset, development, and retention of the changes that result in the systems observed in the attested languages.

The Universality of Concord,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003664/current.pdf?_s=jmDFGywE2UIiesgG,"['Bayirli, Isa']","In this dissertation, we develop and defend a universal theory of concord (i.e. feature sharing between a head noun and the modifying adjectives). We claim that (i) the mechanism for concord is uniform across the grammars of natural languages and (ii) the overt manifestation of concord is suppressed by the intervention of phasal domains. 

When adjectives in a language show concord with the noun they modify, concord morphology usually involves the full set of features of that noun (e.g. gender, number and case). However, there are also languages in which concord targets only a subset of morphosyntactic features of the head noun. We observe that feature combinations that enter into concord in such languages are not random. We show that this observation can be explained with a theory of concord that has the following properties: (i) concord is obligatory whenever phasal domains are inactive (the obligatoriness claim) and (ii) languages that lack concord have phasal Noun Phrase (the phase claim). We provide evidence supporting these claims.

The obligatoriness claim leads to two predictions: (1) idiosyncratic gender languages are gender concord languages and (2) languages with pluralia tantum nouns are plural concord languages. We show that these predictions are empirically supported.

The phase claim implies that a language lacks overt manifestation of concord only if it has a phasal NP. We show that, due to the phasal status of NP, non-concord languages exhibit the following properties: (1) AP movement out of NP is not possible, (2) the Num head need not be obligatory in the extended projection of a noun (leading to number neutrality) and (3) nominal inflectional elements can be shared between coordinated nouns. We provide evidence supporting these claims.","['concord', 'adjectives', 'gender', 'number', 'suspension', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

There is as much evidence for a level of representation somewhere between morphemes and phrases in Chinese as there is in English. Yet as with English, the evidence reveals Chinese words as dynamic, sometimes more like lexicalized wholes and sometimes more like decomposable complexes. Moreover, while semantics, phonology, syntax, and psycholinguistics all point roughly at a word level in Chinese (and English), they do not point in exactly the same direction. After reviewing well-known problems with wordhood in English, linguistic and psycholinguistic evidence for the word level in Chinese, and signs that Chinese words are as variable in nature as they are in English, I show how naive discriminative learning may help express the dynamism of wordhood.

As a case study, a previous corpus-based research identified some specific sound symbolic relationships in Pokemon naming patterns in Japanese [1]. One of the main findings was that the names of Pokemon characters are more likely to contain voiced obstruents and are longer in terms of mora counts, when they undergo evolution (e.g. /nyoromo/ => /nyorobon/; /poppo/ => /pijotto/.). The current study reports three experiments that test whether (i) these patterns are productive in the minds of general Japanese speakers (Experiments 1 and 2), and whether (ii) the same tendency would hold with English speakers (Experiment 3). The results show that the effect of mora length was clearly observed both with Japanese speakers and English speakers; the effects of voiced obstruents were observed clearly with Japanese speakers, and less clearly with English speakers. Further analyses show that familiarity with Pokemon may influence their responses, suggesting the possibility that speakers can learn sound-symbolic patterns from a particular set of lexical items (i.e. “the Pokemon lexicon”).

The syntax of nominal phrases and the morphology of nominal compounds in Mandarin (Chinese): A comparative study,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003630/current.pdf?_s=ZYLuNz7qNHvGRLDd,"['Chen, Fulang']","This paper is concerned with a comparative study of the syntactic derivation of two types of nominal phrases (non-predicative de-constructions and generic de-constructions) and the morphological derivation of the corresponding nominal compounds (endocentric nominal compounds and synthetic nominal compounds) in Mandarin (Chinese).

Bilingualism and Language Dominance as Factors in Maltese Morphological Variation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004013/current.pdf?_s=yNdRZsQxUxoYid4K,"['Drake, Shiloh']","I report the results of a wug task to connect issues of bilingualism and language dominance to psycholinguistic methods, showing that language dominance plays a role in the morphological variation found in Maltese. Research on structural borrowing in language contact situations suggests that morphological borrowing occurs when bilinguals are in a situation where one language is dominant (Brown, 2003). In addition, psycholinguistics research suggests that bilinguals perform differently from monolinguals in metalinguistic tasks (Galambos & Hakuta, 1988; Campbell & Sais, 1995), particularly when they are dominant in one language. The results of the present study suggest that language dominance may be a reliable predictor of their responses.

Maltese, a Semitic language derived from Siculo-Arabic, has had extensive contact with Italian and English as reflected in its lexicon, where roughly half of the words are derived from Arabic and half from Italian and English (Mifsud, 1995). Maltese morphology exhibits both Semitic root-and-pattern word formations (vocalic patterns inserted around a triconsonantal root), as well as formations using concatenative morphology (Borg & Azzopardi-Alexander, 1997). Previous work showed differences in morphological productivity in root-and-pattern versus concatenative constructions (Twist, 2006; Spagnol, 2011), posing a challenge for the development of an accurate model of Maltese morphology. 

Maltese speakers are bilingual, speaking both Maltese and English. Prior psycholinguistic research has found that bilinguals perform differently on metalinguistic tasks (Galambos & Hakuta, 1988; Campbell & Sais, 1995), and bilinguals who are dominant in one language also perform differently from monolinguals and balanced bilinguals (Galambos & Hakuta, 1988; Gathercole, 2007). In addition, sociolinguistic research on Maltese suggests that bilingualism and language contact in tandem with lexical innovation drives language change (Fabri, 2011), particularly in lexical items and novel applications of bound morphemes (e.g., English nerd ‘nerd’ --> Maltese tinnerdja ‘to behave like a nerd’).

Inflectional Dependencies: a study of complex verbal expressions in Ndebele,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003619/current.pdf?_s=BwRUrQnZr-SHGUKB,"['Pietraszko, Asia']","This thesis is a study of the syntax of multi-verb constructions, in which a single clause contains more than one verbal element. Multi-verb constructions are of special interest in light of the hypothesis that clausal structure is headed by a verb. Implemented in terms of extended projections, this hypothesis states that clausal functional structure is the extended projection of a verb. A full understanding of multi-verbal constructions, in which there is no one-to-one verb–clause mapping, relies on refinements of the intimate relation between clause structure and the verbal category. Analyzing various types of multi-verb constructions in Ndebele, a Bantu language of Zimbabwe, I propose a theory multi-verbal syntax which makes explicit the ways in which a single extended projection may contain more than one verb. I propose a basic distinction within the verbal category into projecting verbs and non-projecting verbs. Projecting verbs have the ability to head a full clause and are what we typically think of as lexical verbs. Non-projecting verbs, on the other hand, are inherently unable to project full clausal structure. There are two types of non-projecting verbs in Ndebele. Aspectual auxiliaries are lexical items whose category feature has mixed properties: it has properties of both a lexical verb and some functional head in the clausal spine. The mixed properties are detected by different aspects of their syntax. The second type of non-projecting verb is the default auxiliary (be, in Ndebele), used in compound tenses. The default auxiliary is a verbal expletive, which becomes part of the derivation via last-resort selection. Any multi-verbal construction with more than one lexical (projecting) verb necessarily contains more than one extended projection. Additionally, the thesis is concerned with the role of two syntactic dependencies in the inflectional domain: agreement and selection. Both relations are involved in determining the morphological shape of multi-verb constructions by posing restrictions on the form, category and size of the main lexical verb. Depending on the light/auxiliary verb, it can be a participle (imperfective, past or future), have a subjunctive form (present or past), or be infinitival/clausal. It is argued that such cooccurrence patterns are largely predictable from clause structure and agreement. Selection is involved only in a small set of idiosyncratic cases of complement selection.","['syntax', 'morphology', 'extended projections', 'selection', 'agreement', 'multi-verbal constructions', 'auxiliaries', 'light verbs', 'ndebele', 'bantu']",2017
Blocking and Paradigm Gaps,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002394/current.pdf?_s=b9P3VuRBhiPKCyJU,"['Kastner, Itamar', 'Zu, Vera']","Gaps in morphological paradigms are often explained in terms of blocking: generating one form is blocked by the existence of a paraphrase. Another way of thinking about paradigm gaps dissociates their existence from competition between forms. Unlike in competition-based approaches, systematic gaps can be seen as true gaps; the system might not generate a certain form, but this form is not considered in comparison to others. Adopting this latter approach, we argue that inflectional paradigms are neither morphosyntactic primitives nor the result of competition. This claim is supported by data from two unrelated languages. For Hebrew, we demonstrate that a passive gap is not the result of competition with analytic paraphrases. For Latin, we show that a cyclic, syntax-based approach is superior to a theory that generates nonactive verbs in the lexicon and has them compete against each other. Systematic paradigm gaps are thus argued to result from syntactic structure building, without competition regulating independent morphological constructions.","['competition', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'hebrew', 'latin', 'paradigm gaps', 'voice', 'passive']",2017
How (not) to derive a *ABA: the case of Blansitt's generalisation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003696/current.pdf?_s=-CEN1wyUz2fDTw-h,"['Caha, Pavel']","In this paper, I provide an account for the so-called Blansitt’s generalisation (Blansitt 1988). The generalisation says that in the linear sequence dative—allative—locative, only adjacent functions may be marked the same. In previous work (Bobaljik 2012; Starke 2009; Caha 2009), analogous *ABA patterns have been encoded by the so-called feature cumulation. Feature cumulation means that the amount of features characteristic for individual categories monotonically grows in the order given in any such sequence. However, Blansitt observes that in the case of datives, allatives and locatives, the allative (which is in the middle) tends to be composed of the dative and the locative, so the account based on cumulation does not work. The present paper thus argues for a different representation of the underlying categories, namely as containing (abstractly) the features a, ab and b respectively (following in part Bobaljik & Sauerland 2017). I refer to this as the “overlapping” decomposition. When such a decomposition is combined with the Superset Principle (Starke 2009), it yields both the *ABA restriction and the observed syncretism and containment patterns. I further argue that this is a non-trivial result, since traditional underspecification approaches face significant challenges in deriving the *ABA pattern on the basis of the overlapping decomposition.","['*aba', 'nanosyntax', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017
On the Symmetry of Case in Conjunction,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003603/current.pdf?_s=4DK5EGg8zvHJUF8X,"['Weisser, Philipp']","In this paper, I argue that all of the conjuncts in nominal conjunction always bear the same case. Apparent counterexamples, where conjuncts seem to differ with respect to morphological case marking, are claimed to be either due to a misanalysis of the underlying syntactic structure or due to superficial morphological processes that create the impression of a difference in case marking. Once we control for phenomena of this sort (namely &P-clitics, Suspended Affixation and Allomorphy), we find that case marking is always symmetric in nominal conjunction. This finding is in stark contrast to the phenomenon of phi-agreement which is known to exhibit asymmetry effects. Based on this observation, I show that the standard approach to case assignment according to which case arises only as a reflex of phi-agreement cannot account for this mismatch without stipulative assumptions. Under two more recent approaches to case marking, however, namely the Upward Agree approach as well as the Dependent Case Approach, the observed mismatch between case and agreement falls out as expected. Finally, I show that the generalization established in this paper can be used as a simple diagnostic to distinguish syntactic from morphological case marking alternations.

The account assumes that suppletive roots, despite appearances to the contrary, are not contextual allomorphs, but portmanteaus spelling out two distinct features, one belonging to the lexical root, and another one belonging to the comparative. The regular comparative affix then spells out an additional feature relating to the comparative domain. In other words, we show that the comparative (CMPR) head that enters into the morphological makeup of the comparative (Bobaljik 2012) is to be split up into two distinct heads, C1 and C2 (see also Caha 2016). We extend this idea to SPRL, which we show is likewise to be split up into S1 and S2, in order to account for suppletive ABC patterns. These four distinct heads receive empirical support from facts of the degree morphology in Czech and Latin. The new account of root suppletion allows a straightforward way of deriving the attested and unattested patterns of (root) suppletion in degree comparison. The analysis developed supports the hypothesis that the absence of AAB patterns in degree comparison is due to a constraint of a different nature altogether.","['*aba', 'adjectives', 'suppletion', 'comparative', 'superlative', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

The most prominent construction of this type are adnominal pronoun constructions (APCs) of the we linguists type.
The first part of the thesis provides a survey of expressions of nominal person in a sample of 92 languages from 44 genera, to my knowledge the first larger scale overview of its kind. I review the observable crosslinguistic variation with respect to word order, the presence or absence of definite articles, the possibility of the co-occurrence of demonstratives with pronouns and with respect to restrictions on person-number combinations in expressions of
nominal person.
The second part examines the applicability of the classical pronominal determiner analysis (Abney 1987, Postal 1969) to the data collected in the survey, in particular with respect to word order, the co-occurrence of adnominal pronouns with articles and the person-number restrictions on expressions of nominal person. I discuss alternatives and amendments to the pronominal determiner analysis for problematic data, one important outcome being that
nominal person is not universally encoded in the same position as definiteness.
In the third part, I review the so-called unagreement phenomenon as a case of non-overt nominal person marking and discuss the interaction of person with other deictic features in the nominal domain: the possibility of demonstrative constructions to control non-third person agreement in a few languages as well as personal pronoun-demonstrative constructions (PPDCs) involving demonstratives co-occurring with personal pronouns in some languages. The existence of the latter constructions suggests that person is not universally encoded in the same syntactic position as demonstratives. 
The overall picture emerging is that there is crosslinguistic variation in the locus of person in the extended nominal projection and the types of features that are encoded on the same head as person, although there appears to be a universal tendency for person to be in a relatively high position.","['person', 'nominal structure', 'adnominal pronouns', 'pronominal determiner', 'unagreement', 'demonstratives', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

Second, their sentential distribution is in part context-sensitive, thus based on the categories with which they combine.

This explains the O>S word order but also the fact that straightforward extraction of all vP-internal material is banned. In the case of predominantly VSO languages, however, we propose that syntactic ergativity affects only the transitive subject: extraction of vP-internal adjuncts is unrestricted. This is because in S>O languages, the extraction restriction results from anti-locality, of the kind proposed by Erlewine (2016). We argue, moreover, that both kinds of syntactic ergativity in these languages ultimately arise due to defective intervention of the ergative subject in the Agree relation between INFL and the internal argument. There are essentially two ways to circumvent this problem: either S 'sidesteps' to spec INFL, or O leapfrogs to the outer spec vP.","['accessibility', 'extraction', 'anti-locality', 'a-bar dependency', 'word order', 'defective intervention', 'mayan', 'syntactic ergativity', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

Since SPE, generative grammarians have taken it as given that the distinction between Level 1 and Level 2 affixes is lexical. That is, the class-membership of a given affix is a feature that not only must be memorized, but is also a morphological diacritic. This diacritic is necessary iff there is no other relevant distinction between the two groups of affixes. 
	It is the goal here to demonstrate that there is, in fact, another distinction between these affixes, and that this difference is the true source of the division of affixes into the Level 1 and Level 2 classes. The pertinent distinction has nothing to do with morpho-lexical classification, but is instead purely phonological.

Roots may have syntactic features but this structural property interacts with derivational timing: if a root does not have any active syntactic features, then it must be Late Inserted. In contrast, roots with active syntac- tic features must be inserted early in order for those features to be available to syntactic computation. The empirical picture gets further complicated by the fact that the geometry of features on roots does not nec- essarily match the geometry of features in the extended functional domain.

Words that span multiple phases (Chomsky 2000, 2001, Marantz 2001) are transferred from syntax to phonology (“spelled out”) multiple times. The spelled out material is evaluated by a parallel Optimality Theory grammar (OT; Prince and Smolensky 1993/2004), which builds output prosodic structure. The cyclic syntax-parallel phonology model predicts that transferring words from syntax to phonology over multiple phases results in recursion of Phonological Words (PWds) in some languages (Ito and Mester 2009). In these languages, including Chukchansi Yokuts (firsthand fieldwork) and Creek (data from Martin 2011), prosodic recursion reflects cyclic word construction. The input representation of multiphasal verbs and prosodic well-formedness and Match constraints together generate a typology including languages with different recursive PWd structures or no PWd recursion at all. The predicted typology of prosodic structures of multiphasal words closely matches the attested range of language variation. 

This dissertation brings together insights from several theories in multiple sub-fields of linguistics, including Phase Theory, the Copy Theory of Movement, Distributed Morphology and Match Theory. The cyclic syntax-parallel phonology model provides a tool for assessing the claims of one sub-field using evidence from another sub-field. The prosodic organization of a word can provide insight into its phasal derivation; conversely, the morphosyntactic structure of a word can shed light on the complex prosodic structure it displays.","['morphology-phonology interface', 'phases', 'prosody', 'match theory', 'prosodic morphology', 'typology', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2017
Grammaticalization and 'lateral' grammaticalization: a new perspective on linguistic interfaces and functional categories,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003139/current.pdf?_s=YRTqt0n5cIIBeNIS,"['Tse, Keith']","Simpson and Wu (2002) analyze Chinese shi-de constructions and propose a
new type of grammaticalization in the Minimalist framework called 'lateral' grammaticalization (LG). It is compared with Roberts and Roussou (R&R) (2003) and van Gelderen's (2004, 2011) Minimalist analyses of grammaticalization (henceforth 'standard' grammaticalization (SG)) and
while both display 'structural simplification', as defined by R&R (2003:198-201) and van Gelderen (2011:13-21), LG does not display 'upward feature analysis', which is a diagnostic trait of SG (R&R (2003:200)). Rather, there is 'lateral feature analysis' where one functional category (e.g. D) is re-analysed as another (e.g. T) (S&W (2002:201-202)).Furthermore, while examples of SG regularly display semantic and morphophonological weakening (R&R (2003:218-229)), those of LG do not, which seems to suggest that 'upward feature analysis', not 'lateral feature analysis', is the cause behind weakening in grammaticalization. Bybee (2003, 2011) proposes that frequency is the main driving force behind weakening in grammaticalization, since as the grammaticalizing element undergoes weakening in semantics, it becomes compatible with a wider range of complements and hence rises in frequency which causes it to become automatised and lose morphophonological substance. There is therefore a causal relationship between semantic and morphophonological weakening ('parallel reduction hypothesis'/'co-evolution of meaning and substance' (Bybee et al (1994:17-21)). In my comparison between the Romance future (Latin infinitive + habere) (SG) and the Chinese copula shi (LG), it is discovered that 'upward feature analysis' in SG does indeed give rise to 'context expansion', namely a widening in the range of complementation (cf Bybee (2003)), which leads to rise in frequency and morphophonological weakening, while 'lateral feature analysis' in LG crucially leads to 'context reduction' which lowers the frequency of the grammaticalizing element and hence pre-empts its morphophonological weakening. Cross-linguistic patterns of weakening are examined and there seems to be a correlation between frequency effects in syntactic change and the rate of morphophonological weakening in functional elements. This is significant, since it is widely assumed that functional elements are necessarily weak (cf Selkirk (1984:335-337)) when the evidence from a formal analysis of grammaticalization suggests that the empirical properties of functional elements, namely their differential rates of weakening, can (and should) be derived from their genesis, namely grammaticalization (SG/LG). This opens up new research questions which are left for future investigations.","['minimalism', 'grammaticalization', 'language change', 'historical syntax', 'latin', 'romance', 'chinese', 'syntax-phonology interface', 'functional categories', 'copula', 'keith tse', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2017

Yet this morphological marking also appears on anticausative verbs, which have different syntactic and semantic properties. I provide an analysis of reflexivity in Hebrew which does not make reference to dedicated reflexive morphosyntax. By combining independently needed functional heads, the proposal explains what in the syntax underlies this morphology and how different kinds of verbs end up with identical morphophonological properties. To this end, I consider the lexical semantics of individual lexical roots as well as the syntactic configurations in which roots and arguments are embedded. The resulting theory is one in which lexical roots trigger specific interpretations of the syntax at the interfaces.","['hebrew', 'lexical semantics', 'reflexivity', 'unaccusativity', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

I will proceed to outline an alternative, in which the syntactic building blocks are functional terminals, functors.  In that alternative, functors combine with roots, where 'Root' denotes a primarily phonological unit which is, on its own, both syntactically and semantically inert.  A word, within such an approach, is a phonological domain with fixed, language-specific properties (e.g. the domain of primary stress in English), which may correspond to syntactic and semantic constituents of variable complexity.  The picture, as a whole, has ramifications not only for the construction of words and syntactic phrases, but also for the interface between phonological representations, syntactic representations, and the nature of listedness for (so-called) lexical meaning.

The position of case markers relative to possessive agreement: variation within Hungarian,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003454/current.pdf?_s=5FuiTLfbybpXFtGA,"['Dékány, Éva']","This paper inquires into two issues of Hungarian PPs. Firstly, when Hungarian pronouns bear an oblique case, the case marker must be followed by possessive agreement. Secondly, this pronoun-case-agreement order contrasts with the order found in garden variety possessive structures: ordinary possessive DPs feature the order noun-agreement-case. The goal of this paper is to offer an account of these puzzling phenomena. I argue that a PP structure in which PPs are projected from a silent place noun and the Ground is merged as the possessor of place (Terzi, 2005, 2008, 2010; Botwinik-Rotem, 2008; Botwinik-Rotem and Terzi, 2008; Pantcheva, 2008; Cinque, 2010a; Noonan, 2010, and Nchare and Terzi, 2014) allows an elightening analysis of the appearance and position of the possessive agreement in PPs. I also discuss how certain surface differences between PPs and ordinary possessive constructions can be accounted for while maintaining the possessive analysis of PPs. By showing that a PP structure with a possessive core yields a natural account of the intricate Hungarian data, the paper strengthens the case for a possessive-based approach to PPs in Universal Grammar.","['pp', 'place', 'oblique case', 'possessive structure', 'possessive agreement', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

encoding) and syntax (with long-distance extraction) and shows that
existing analyses in terms of local constraint conjunction cannot be
transferred to harmonic grammar analyses:
Whereas cumulative constraint interaction can be selectively switched
off in local conjunction analyses, this is impossible  for principled
reasons in harmonic grammar analyses. Consequently, even though
harmonic grammar is explicitly designed to capture cumulative effects,

Attributes of Attribution,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003452/current.pdf?_s=6KXs-2DARVZpBWWF,"['Belk, Zoë']","Attributive adjectives have a number of properties that distinguish them from predicative adjectives and other modifiers of the noun. For example, attributives are subject to ordering restrictions that do not apply to other types of nominal modifier, and they exhibit scope interactions unlike predicatives or relative clauses. This thesis argues that these properties are best captured by an analysis in which all attributives share the same relationship with the noun and discusses the ways in which our understanding of a number of phenomena at the edges of attribution must change.

One influential theory of adjective ordering restrictions (discussed in Larson 2000a and Cinque 2010, among others) holds that violations of the ordering hierarchy that applies to many attributive adjectives are due to the existence of modifiers that superficially look like attributives but are in fact derived from reduced relative clauses. These derived attributives are merged higher than underived attributives and are unordered with respect to each other. I show that the offending adjectives do not behave syntactically like true relative clauses, whether full or reduced. In addition, while all attributive semantics is asymmetric, true relatives involve symmetric modification. This single-source approach entails a rethinking of some of the effects commonly understood to result from attribution. I will address two such effects, which could be taken as evidence in favour of a derived attributive approach to attribution, and show that they are best analyzed using a homogeneous approach to attribution. 

In languages where the noun follows its modifiers, the ordering of AP and PP modifiers is free and their scope varies with c-command. In noun-initial languages their order is fixed, with the AP preceding other modifiers, and their scope is ambiguous. This pattern could be taken as evidence for a second source of adnominal modification, if the high position of the AP in noun-final languages is a reduced relative clause. However, I show that both the ordering and scope effects are due to a novel constraint restricting the linear order of attributive and other modifiers. The ordering patterns of AP and PP modifiers are therefore not evidence for the existence of derived attributives.  

One piece of evidence for the dual-source theory of attribution is that some adjectives have unexpectedly rigid requirements for adjacency and nonintersectivity (for example, in the phrase 'hard worker'). I demonstrate that  cases like these are not true attribution but are instead a type of bracketing paradox. I argue that these bracketing paradoxes are derived by movement at LF. This movement (and indeed all movement) is restricted in the type of information that must be retained before and after the operation takes place, but is otherwise free. Therefore, these examples do not provide evidence for two different types of attributive modifier. 

The proposed analysis of attribution allows for a simplification of adjectival modification, as it does not require a distinction between derived and underived attributive adjectives. The analysis presented in this thesis entails a novel categorization of certain adjectival phenomena, but readily accounts for the empirical intricacies of attribution.

We first illustrate prosodic smothering with novel data from two genetically unrelated languages, Macedonian (Slavic) and Kaqchikel (Mayan). We then provide a unified account of prosodic smothering based on a principled extension of the theory of prosodic subcategorization (Inkelas 1990, Peperkamp 1997, Chung 2003, Yu 2003, Paster 2006, Bye 2007, among others). Prosodic subcategorization typically involves requirements placed on items to the left or the right of the selecting morpheme. We show that prosodic smothering naturally emerges in a theory which also allows for subcategorization in the vertical dimension, such that morphemes may select for the prosodic category which immediately dominates them in surface prosodic structure. This extension successfully reduces two apparent cases of non-local prosodic conditioning to the effects of strictly local prosodic selection.","['prosody', 'subcategorization', 'clitics', 'macedonian', 'kaqchikel', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2017

Consequently, the compositional interaction of polysemous prepositions with other parts of speech can determine which specific sense emerges in a sentence.

It addresses data that have not previously been analysed in the literature, involving so-called Boolean constructions (e.g. en la estación y la calle). Also, the paper shows that a single treatment can capture all the relevant data.

Two contrasting views of the role of lexical meaning in the analysis of such variation can be found in the literature: (i) uniformity, whereby lexical meaning is universal, and variation arises from idiosyncratic differences in the inventory and phonological shape of language-particular functional material, and (ii) transparency, whereby systematic variation in form arises from systematic variation in the meaning of basic lexical items. 

In this volume, Itamar Francez and Andrew Koontz-Garboden contrast these views as applied to the empirical domain of property concept sentences - sentences expressing adjectival predication and their translational equivalents across languages. They demonstrate that property concept sentences vary systematically between possessive and predicative form, and propose a transparentist analysis of this variation that links it to the lexical denotations of basic property concept lexemes. At the heart of the analysis are qualities: mass-like model theoretic objects that closely resemble scales. The authors contrast their transparentist analysis with uniformitarian alternatives, demonstrating its theoretical and empirical advantages. They then show that the proposed theory of qualities can account for interesting and novel observations in two central domains of grammatical theory: the theory of syntactic categories, and the theory of mass nouns.

Perspective is syntactic: evidence from anaphora,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002893/current.pdf?_s=28vyNG2HvCRdW48L,"['Sundaresan, Sandhya']","The goal of this paper is to argue that perspective, expressed along the spatio-temporal and mental dimensions, is syntactically motivated. To this end, I present evidence from a linguistic phenomenon where grammatical perspective has long been observed to play a central role — namely, non-local anaphora (a cover-term not only for long-distance anaphora and backward anaphora but also for logophora). The evidence that I provide comes primarily from Tamil, a language of the Dravidian family, spoken predominantly in parts of South India. Non-local anaphora in Tamil, like in Icelandic, Italian, Japanese and in its fellow Dravidian language Malayalam, is perspective-driven: i.e. the antecedent of a successfully bound anaphor must denote a mental or spatio-temporal perspective-holder toward some predication containing the anaphor. However, unlike the other languages mentioned here, Tamil provides compelling evidence in the form of verbal agreement that the perspective that regulates anaphoric dependencies is syntactically represented. In particular, I will argue that the agreement marking that obtains on the clausemate verb of the anaphor in Tamil, when this anaphor occurs in nominative case (the case that generally feeds agreement), seems to be anomalously triggered, not by the anaphor or by its antecedent, but by a silent perspectival pronoun local to the verb. Assuming that agreement is a morphosyntactic process, such a thesis, if correct, then entails that perspective must be syntactically (i.e. structurally and featurally) instantiated.","['perspective', 'anaphora', 'agree(ment)', 'antecedence', 'binding', 'non-obligatory control', 'phi-features', 'indexical shift', 'grammatical modularity', 'tamil', 'syntax', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2017

Three factors were manipulated: type of possessive pronoun (overt vs. null), syntactic configuration regulating the intra-sentential relation between the pronoun and its antecedent (locality and c-command), the interpretation assigned to the pronoun (anaphoric, non-anaphoric and exophoric). The results suggests that the hypothesis is correct, although a significant difference among BP and Finnish was found, showing that Finns has less acceptance of non-anaphoric readings for null pronouns.

Voice morphology in Japanese argument structures,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003374/current.pdf?_s=QmtJuCHH6P_0ae2t,"['Oseki, Yohei']","In this paper, we review and investigate verbal argument structures in Japanese, especially transitivity alternations where transitive-intransitive verb “pairs” (e.g. mawa-s-u vs. mawa-r-u, ‘turn’) have been exclusively analyzed with mixed results in favor of both lexical (Miyagawa, 1984; Jacobsen, 1992) and syntactic (Miyagawa, 1998; Nishiyama, 1998) strands. Empirically, we closely examine hitherto unexplored verb “triplets” (Suga, 1980; de Chene, 2016), in which the same lexical roots are shared by multiple transitive/intransitive verbs with different transitivity morphology, and reveal their differential syntactic behaviors in the interpretation of external arguments (between multiple transitive verbs sharing the same root) and unaccusativity (between multiple intransitive verbs sharing the same root). Theoretically, within the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz, 1993), we propose the system in which transitivity morphology, previously identified as little v (Volpe, 2005; Harley, 2008; Marantz, 2013), is analyzed as Voice morphology differently specified regarding the presence/absence of external arguments (Schafer, 2008; Marantz, 2013; Wood, 2015; Alexiadou et al., 2015), and explain the syntax of transitivity alternations. Furthermore, the proposed Voice system will be extended to the broader empirical domain of Japanese argument structures and derive ditransitive verbs, “figure ditransitive” verbs, and syntactic causatives/passives. Finally, we discuss several theoretical consequences of our proposal concerning (i) lexical vs. syntactic approaches to argument structure, (ii) the distinctness of Voice and little v (Harley, 2013; Legate, 2014), and (iii) the unification of argument-introducing functional heads under i* (Wood & Marantz, 2017).","['argument structure', 'transitivity alternation', 'voice', 'little v', 'distributed morphology', 'japanese', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017
The morphosyntax of exhaustive focus: A view from Awing (Grassfields Bantu),https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003291/current.pdf?_s=ijJzWjhawWx036jp,"['Fominyam, Henry', 'Simik, Radek']","We provide an analysis of focus and exhaustive focus in the Grassfields Bantu language Awing. We show that Awing provides an exceptionally clear window into the syntactic properties of exhaustive focus. Our analysis reveals that the Awing particle LE realizes a left-peripheral head which, in terms of its syntactic position in the functional sequence, closely corresponds to the Foc(us) head in standard cartographic analyses (e.g. Rizzi 1997). Crucially, however, we show that LE is only used if the focus it associates with receives a presuppositional exhaustive (cleft-like) interpretation. Other types of focus are not formally encoded in Awing. In order to reflect this semantic specification of LE, we call its syntactic category Exh rather than Foc. Another point of difference from what one would consider a ""standard"" cartographic Foc head is that the focus associated with LE is not realized in its specifier but rather within its complement. More particularly, we argue that LE associates with the closest maximal projection it asymmetrically c-commands. The broader theoretical relevance of the present work is at least two-fold. First, our paper offers novel evidence in support of Horvath's (2010) Strong Modularity Hypothesis for Discourse Features, according to which information structural notions such as focus cannot be represented in narrow syntax as formal features. We argue that the information structure-related movement operations that Awing exhibits can be accounted for by interface considerations, in the spirit of Reinhart (2006). Second, our data support the generality of the so called closeness requirement on association with focus Jacobs (1983), which dictates that a focus-sensitive particle be as close to its focus as possible (in terms of c-command). What is of special significance is the fact that Awing exhibits two different avenues to satisfying closeness. The standard one - previously described for German or Vietnamese and witnessed here for the Awing particle TSOE 'only' - relies primarily on the flexible attachment of the focus-sensitive particle. The Awing particle LE, in contrast, is syntactically rigid. For that reason, the satisfaction of closeness relies solely on the flexibility of other syntactic constituents.","['awing', 'grassfields bantu', 'exhaustive focus', 'focus encoding', 'verbal morphosyntax', 'interface of syntax and information structure', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

It is claimed that the naming (not describing) of an entity type is what makes a noun a noun (formally, what turns a root into a noun). An ‘entity type’ is understood as an e-type element in the speaker’s ontology, not yet determined as denoting over kinds or their object instances. Higher projections turn this into a predicate, and further grammatical specifications may restrict its reference to what is modelled as elements of a partition, or as atoms, but without a single countability switch. Whether the reference is to kinds or to instances depends on all the specifications that jointly define a division of reference. In particular, plurality enforces an instance reading where the partition it determines is based on spatiotemporally situated parts, in the absence of other criteria for individuality. Beside determining what types of plurals may not license a kind reading, this view of the division of reference analyzes fake mass nouns ('furniture') as a count structure inside a mass shell, which predictively relates their semantics to their morphology. The same analytical framework, with no additional stipulations, explains the properties of non-countable plural nouns, both arising from mass nouns ('waters') and from non-nominal bases ('beginnings'). Finally, a case of mixed-gender DP shows that unexpected interactions between gender and number can be interpreted as cases where the determination of an agreement class is bound up with the determination of part structure.

event that is unexpected. This original constructional meaning is gradually lost due to a
process of overtification; the use of the infinitive increases in contexts in which the
event is not unexpected. The subsequent development of the temporal meaning is
motivated by the failure of listeners to accommodate too-costly presuppositions in a

From a compositional perspective, the 'so' in 'sogenannt' will be reasoned to be identical in function to quotation marks as a means to refer to a linguistic shape through demonstration.

The Influence of Bilectalism and Non-standardization on the Perception of Native Grammatical Variants ,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003340/current.pdf?_s=2qr_1KjYr_eLmMvy,"['Leivada, Evelina', 'Papadopoulou, Elena', 'Kambanaros, Maria', 'Grohmann, Kleanthes K.']","Research in speakers of closely related varieties has shown that bilectalism and non-standardization affect speakers’ perception of the variants that exist in their native languages in a way that is absent from the performance of their monolingual peers. One possible explanation for this difference is that non-standardization blurs the boundaries of grammatical variants and increases grammatical fluidity. Affected by such factors, bilectals become less accurate in identifying the variety to which a grammatical variant pertains. Another explanation is that their differential performance derives from the fact that they are competent in two varieties. Under this scenario, the difference is due to the existence of two linguistic systems in the course of development, and not to how close or standardized these systems are. This study employs a novel variety-judgment task in order to elucidate which of the two explanations holds. Having administered the task to monolinguals, bilectals, and bilinguals, including heritage language learners and L1 attriters, we obtained a dataset of 16,245 sentences. The analysis shows differential performance between bilectal and bilingual speakers, granting support for the first explanation.

Overstanding Idren: Special Features of Rastafari English Morphology,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002196/current.pdf?_s=5qMqkmDTMSpoKe5j,"['Slade, Benjamin']","This paper investigates the structure and development of two unique morphological (word-building) processes found in Rastafari English [RE]: ""overstandings"", e.g. forms like outformer, livicate etc.; and ""I-words"" like ital, Issembly, inity etc.

I show that these two RE morphological phenomena are distinct from any processes previously identified in other languages, both in terms of form and function. Overstandings like downpress (< oppress, treated as if composed of up + press) superficially resemble folk etymology, in which a morphologically-opaque word is re-analysed; e.g. woodchuck (< Algonquian otchek), shamefaced (< earlier English shamefast ``stuck in shame''). The process of folk etymology, however, involves a misunderstanding of the original sense triggering a reformation, while overstandings involve an intentional re-etymologising where the change in form reflects change in meaning and/or perspective. That is, the standard English is treated as representing a lower, incomplete understanding, whereas the new RE form signals a higher comprehension (i.e. overstanding). Many overstandings are formed on the basis of binary oppositions like up vs. down, over vs. under, dead vs. (a)live, love vs. hate etc. (reflecting an ideological binarity lexicalised by Zion vs. Babylon).

I-words involve a transformational process replacing initial syllables by the diphthong /ai/, thus Iration for creation. The underlying process involved seems historically connected to the restructuring of the RE pronominal system, which not only eliminates me in favour of I for all grammatical case forms, but also largely eschews the use of the second person form you (often replaced by the I). Not only is ``you'' replaced, but also other phonological sequences yu, thus I-man (/aiman/) from human (Jamaican Creole /yuman/), and similarly forms like inity, iniverse, and that from this point the process was eventually generalised to include the replacement of any initial syllable by /ai/.","['rastafari', 'jamaica', 'creole', 'rastatalk', 'i-words', 'iformation', 'overstanding', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2017

Each successive layer of nominal structure makes the person features in PhiP less accessible to an external agreement probe. The person hierarchy thus reduces to an effect of minimality: the hierarchy is simply a statement of the amount of nominal structure that intervenes between a probe and the person features in PhiP. This approach does away with the need for stipulated feature geometries and ties the person hierarchy directly to the well-established phrasal syntax of nominals.","['person hierarchies', 'nominal structure', 'agreement', 'inverse marking', 'minimality', 'algonquian', 'meskwaki', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

The major theoretical claim of this study is the following. IC, being the [+realis] morpheme in Arapaho, appears in a high functional projection in the clause, namely C; it is analyzed as the spell-out of C[+realis]. As such, it competes for this position with a number of morphemes belonging to the CP domain in the language. I will argue that the competition for the C head is driven by the structural properties of the verbal morphology rather than by specific features expressed by the competing morphemes. More specifically, I will suggest that Arapaho is a simple CP language, meaning that only one C head can be present in a clause at a time.","['algonquian', 'arapaho', 'initial change', 'syntax', 'morphology', 'cp domain', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

They are categorially verbal at all levels of the syntax, including having structural subjects rather than possessor specifiers. Their nominal behavior is entirely due to the unvalued Case feature borne by their Infl head, which they share with all participial verb forms. I then argue that agent nominalizations are categorially nominal at all levels of the syntax, and that the verb-like case assignment of transitive agent nominalizations is due to the verbal Aspect feature borne by their nominalizing head. Vedic Sanskrit, Northern Paiute, and Sakha evidence is shown to favor this analysis over B&V’s analysis of intransitive agent nominalizations as nominal equivalents of Voice heads and of transitive agent nominalizations as nominal equivalents of Aspect heads. The two “mixed” categories –-- gerunds and transitive nominalizations –-- thus prove to be formally duals in that they are respectively verbs with Case and nouns with Aspect.","['event nominalizations', 'agent nominalizations', 'lexicalism', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2017

Affixes that are roots show ‘flexible’ categorial behavior, are subject to ‘lexical’ phonological rules, and may trigger idiosyncratic meanings.

This divergence coincides with an exponential increase in the textual raw frequency of the adverbial construction, where word order fixation, erosion of the inflectional morphology and a change in the possibilities for time adjunction among others are found to occur at around the same time.

We show that the surface position of accent depends on syllable count, root transitivity, and the type of inflectional affix present, classifying affixes into dominant, recessive, and rightmost-preserving sub-types. Further, we argue that tense/mood suffixes are associated with different cophonologies (Inkelas & Zoll 2007) depending on which stem syllable they assign accent to and whether they enforce iterative iambs or trochees. Finally, in Ese’eja when accent is assigned outside the window, the position of primary prominence falls on a position which is rhythmically dependent on the window-external accent, e.g. uniformly two syllables away, termed ‘Rhythmic Repair’.

This conclusion is reached through a detailed comparison of INFL and verbal auxiliaries, revealing striking asymmetries, syntactic and phonological, between the two. The autonomy of INFL is argued to be a reflex of how verbal morphology is organized into complex heads in Bantu languages.

The typological implications of this renanalysis of Cupeño stress are then discussed; without empirical support from Cupeño, it is suggested that ""root faithfulness"" plays no role in determining word stress in lexical accent systems cross-linguistically.","['uto-aztecan', 'stress typology', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2017
Formal lexical entries for French Clitics: PF dissociations of single marked features,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003578/current.pdf?_s=6LU0JcEHQsLPtn8F,"['Emonds, Joseph']","Systems of pronominal clitics for arguments and adverbial adjuncts of verbs in Romance languages have several regular properties that widely accepted grammatical models have yet to account for. The analysis here accounts for (i) orderings among French clitics that do not reflect syntactic phrasal ordering; (ii) the limited ‘structural distance’ between clitics and the interpreted phrases they replace; (iii) why clitics frequently have the same form as strong pronouns; and (iv) the extent to which language-particular clitic paradigms conform to Borer’s Conjecture. This system uses no clitic movements, and expresses all generalisations in terms of formalized, constrained lexical entries. Taken together, clitic properties suggest that groups of clitics are single lexical entries inserted in Phonological Form, with allomorphs specified by the parentheses/ brace notations, and a “dissociation” principle called Alternative Realization.

Morphology: Divided and Conquered?,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003580/current.pdf?_s=aR7t_Vse0SCAZVhe,"['Veselovska, Lida', 'Emonds, Joseph']","Concentrating on the taxonomy of grammatical morphemes, this study shows that traditional definitions of inflectional vs. derivational morphemes do not pass more rigorous testing, although they probably reflect instinctive distinctions present in a natural language system. The authors propose to define the distinctions by referring to derivational stages, namely by distinguishing levels of insertion for morphemes. Most of what is usually classified as derivational morphology and subject to Williams’s (1981) Right Hand Head Rule are morphemes which enter derivations in narrow syntax. As such, they conform to what is here termed a Logical Form Interpretation Condition, which allows only one syntactic feature per morpheme. On the other hand, morphemes such as agreements are not subject to the Right Hand Head Rule and result from post-syntactic insertion and exhibit cross-classification. The authors propose that the source of these bound inflections is the process of Alternative Realisation.  They argue that their new distinction between derivational and inflectional morphology correlates with testable semantic, phonetic and syntactic properties and that in terms of these properties, both are necessary parts of an adequate formal linguistic framework. A curious aspect of the conclusions is that W. Humboldt's division in 1820 between morphemes that express several features (inflection) and those which express only one (agglutination) turns out to be the best analysis, with the majority of affixes felt to be 'inflections' by todayS linguists of almost all persuasions (mood, tense, noun plurals, ádjectival comparison, etc.) turn out not to be.

In Spanish [gender] has to be specified as [+fem] or [-fem]. In human nominals, gender is specified in Syntax, and then [+fem] and [-fem] receive a sex construal (“female” or “male”). The remainder nominals are assignated [±fem] in Morphology, through an exhaustivity condition. However, sometimes a non-human nominal can also receive a gender specification in the Syntax, although under a different feature architecture from that of the human nominals.

Cross-linguistic research has recently implied the need to reconsider ‘the more interaction, the more acquisition’ model. We are also reminded that structural-linguistic measures, such as vocabulary size and mean length of utterance are only one aspect of a child’s communicative competence, but some other skills related to pragmatics and conversation are required for language competence. The present study investigates the development of conversational and socio-pragmatic strategies in child discourse from a functional perspective. We especially focus on the impact of the parental input, and question the role of child’s mother in the development of a child’s conversational skills with particular regard to the question-answer forming, positive and negative reinforcement, the effects of frequency, and length of conversation. Our research aims to establish the relationship between the challenging communicative environment (lengthy conversations, parent-initiated speech, answers-at-hand, avoidance of motherese, etc.) and the development of a child’s communicative competence. Our participants have been selected from 5 families. The group comprises totally 5 mothers and 5 Turkish-speaking children. We classified the families as conservative, conservative-pragmatic or modern-educated, and the children as younger and older. The data has been collected via open-ended interviews, and has been transcribed and tagged for analysis. We have found various patterns in parental input shaping a child’s discourse, and the results revealed a significant difference between the two target groups’ conversational strategies, which is due to the critical age for discourse strategies. While the mother’s attempt to adapt her discourse resulted in self-confidence and freedom to question in children, as well as encouragement in initiating conversation to the older children, discouragement from asking questions and from discussing with older individuals had the reverse effect on the older children.","['child language development', 'morphology']",2016

However, although phasal complements have no theoretical status in the phase theory (only phases do), they are taken to define spell-out units. This paper argues for an approach where phases define spell-out domains, which means that what is sent to spell-out is the phase itself. Several arguments to this effect are presented regarding syntax-phonology interaction (in particular, encliticization in Bulgarian and Arabic, stress assignment in German and English, raddoppiamento fonosintattico in Abruzzese, and tone sandhi in Taiwanese), as well as more theoretical issues such as labeling. The assumption, however, has significant consequences for successive-cyclic movement. If phases are sent to spell-out and what is sent to spell-out is inaccessible to the syntax, successive-cyclic movement cannot target phases. Under the account argued for here, successive-cyclic movement therefore does not proceed via phases (i.e. phasal edges). As a result, the account also eliminates the PIC.

The Syntax of Semantic Agreement in English,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003207/current.pdf?_s=sEUvNwOYi3bGmOxb,"['Smith, Peter W.']","This paper investigates the properties of plural agreement that is triggered by collective nouns in British English. Both singular and plural agreement are able to appear with these collective nouns, which are shown to be morphologically singular but semantically plural. Plural agreement however is systematically more restricted than singular agreement, appearing in a subset of the environments where singular agreement is allowed. Restrictions on plural come from the nature of agreement; semantic agreement features can only enter into agreement when the controller of agreement c-commands the target of agreement, whereas morphologically motivated agreement is not subject to the same structural restriction. This asymmetry between the two types of agreement is shown to arise from the proposal that AGREE (Chomsky 2000, 2001) is distributed over the syntactic and post-syntactic component (Arregi & Nevins 2012).","['agreement', 'directionality', 'semantic agreement', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2016

The goal of the paper is to identify the common paths of diachronic change of these verbal forms and to put forward a formal account of the observed diachronic changes. From a diachronic perspective, our analysis shows that the functional structure of non-finite forms may become more enriched, a conclusion that is at odds with traditional findings, which generally argue for simplification, not enrichment of functional structure.

This state of affairs has led, on the one hand, to the perpetuation of proposals that are hard to relate to the biological literature and, on the other, to ill-placed criticism on the progress and even the very legitimacy of a biologically-informed study of language. By reviewing different ways in which research under the biolinguistics label has been carried out, as well as some common criticisms, we hope to dispel some misconceptions about what constitutes a biolinguistic approach, as well as point out what we contend is real progress in the study of the biological bases and evolution of the human language faculty, to which the term is better and rightly applied.","['biolinguistics', 'generative grammar', 'interdisciplinarity', 'language faculty', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2016

With this is mind, we critically discuss the status of Vergnaud licensing in six languages lacking morphological case and agreement. While Luganda appears to systematically lack a Vergnaud licensing requirement, Makhuwa more consistently displays evidence in favour of it, as do all of the analytic languages that we survey (Mandarin, Yoruba, Jamaican Creole and Thai). We conclude that, while it seems increasingly problematic to characterise nominal licensing in terms of uninterpretable/abstract Case features, we nonetheless need to retain a (possibly universal) notion of nominal licensing, the explanation for which remains opaque.

However, there are other phonological processes in Czech (infinitival lengthening), which suggest that the root and the theme marker form a constituent to the exclusion of the prefix: [pref [root theme]]. We argue that the apparent contradiction is resolved by prefix movement (Svenonius 2004). The prefix and the root are merged together, and there is a cycle of phonological computation that determines the vowel/zero status of the alternation site in the prefix. After the first cycle, the theme marker is added and the prefix moves higher up in the structure. This creates a remnant constituent containing just the root and the theme marker, and it is this remnant constituent that is subject to the infinitival lengthening.","['prefix', 'verb', 'czech', 'russian', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2016

Furthermore, the Icelandic pattern manifests a structural interaction which is similar to English do-support and we refer to it as the-support.

What You See Is What You Get.Get: Surface Transparency and Ambiguity of Nominalizing Reduplication in American Sign Language,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003185/current.pdf?_s=gCcTFWpWQgnwmDBX,"['Abner, Natasha']","Nominalizing reduplication in American Sign Language (ASL) is an ambiguous process that can derive both concrete object- and result-denoting nominals. The properties of this nominalization process, including this ambiguity, are accounted for here by appealing to the discrete and surface transparent morphology the language uses to encode components of event (Wilbur 2003, 2010) and argument (Benedicto and Brentari 2004) structure. Nominalizing reduplication is shown to be a process that nominalizes (and reduplicates) only the low portion of verbal structure responsible for encoding the event result (VP-Res). Direct nominalization of this VP-Res constituent yields nominals with result-denoting interpretations. Concrete object-denoting interpretations may arise when the verbal structure contains an argument classifier, evident in the handshape of the verbal predicate. In such cases, the nominal argument introduced by the classifier serves as the input to reduced relative clause formation, yielding a concrete object-denoting interpretation. The interpretive ambiguity is thus reduced to ambiguity in the syntactic structure underlying the derived nominal. This approach falls in line with longstanding structural approaches to nominalization and more recent proposals regarding processes of reduplication (Inkelas and Zoll 2005).

Two ways of encoding location in Greek: Locative applicatives and prepositions,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002975/current.pdf?_s=KPuyLemOV-bvefNG,"['Daskalaki, Evangelia', 'Mavrogiorgos, Marios']","Cross-linguistically, oblique theta roles such as location can be encoded by both adpositions and applicative morphemes. In this paper we argue that Standard Modern Greek (SMG), a language that encodes location primarily with prepositions, has a set of formal, morphologically complex predicates that consist of an intransitive verbal root and a locative prefix, and behave like locative applicative constructions. We argue that this prefix is a low applicative head, licensing the addition of a LOCATIVE DP argument to the intransitive verbal root. Specifically, this applicative head: (i) case- and theta-licenses the added argument, but being void of phi features, it blocks its cliticization; (ii) is distinct from a homophonous free standing P semantically and syntactically; (iii) is undergoing grammaticalization, as evidenced by the emergence of a novel configuration, in which the locative predicates combine with locative PPs that retrieve semantic and syntactic information of the locative prefix. Our findings show that applicatives may come in various flavors, that a language may use both analytic and synthetic devices to encode location which are not derivationally related, and that lexical/inherent case does not necessarily reduce to a PP structure.","['modern greek', 'applicatives', 'adpositions', 'lexical case', 'grammaticalization', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2016

that transitive subject agreement need not always involve a high functional head, i.e. T0, but may
instead be the result of a local relation between the subject and a low functional head, v0. In
Mayan languages, grammatical relations are head-marked on the predicate through two series of
morphemes, known as “Set A” (ergative/possessive) and “Set B” (absolutive). I argue that Set
A morphemes reflect a local relationship of agreement between transitive v0 and the subject in
its specifier position and, in an analogous structural configuration, between possessive n0 and the
possessor. Crucially, I show that no higher functional projection is involved. This is important
in light of proposals that ergative agreement systems are epiphenomenal, resulting from standard
nominative agreement from T0 which is blocked from agreeing with morphologically case-marked
ergative subjects (Woolford 2010). In this paper I examine the morphologically ergative Mayan
language Chol to show true ergative agreement is possible even in the absence of morphological
case. This paper has implications for the typology of ergative case and agreement systems, and

Against this background, we look at an alternation in vocalic length that can be found with a couple of prefixes in Czech. We argue that the best way to understand this alternation is in terms of their free/bound status. Hence, we propose that despite the fact that the prefixes are always glued to the verb, they actually undergo the same process as Germanic particles. The reason why they are always glued to the verb is because of the way pied-piping works; when the verb moves, it moves as a big phrase and always carries the particle along.",['v1 [March 2016]'],2016

Earlier investigations of the syntax and semantics of FCIs in Hungarian include Hunyadi (1991; 2002), Abrusán (2007) and Szabó (2012). In my paper, I show that FCIs in Hungarian occupy the syntactic position associated with distributive quantifiers (É. Kiss 2010). Furthermore, I examine the quantificational force of FCIs by the well-known battery of quantification tests (for a previous application for Hungarian, cf. Surányi 2006): almost-modification, modification by exceptive phrase, donkey anaphora, predicative use, is-modification, incorporation and split reading with modals. My findings of
mixed quantificational behaviour provide further corroboration for the analysis of FCIs as quantificationally underspecified intensional dependent indefinites.","['free-choice items', 'quantification', 'syntax–semantics interface', 'syntax', 'semantics', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2016

In addition, the choice of lexemes they analyzed was far from adequate. Their set of irregular verbs contained many verbs formed by adding some prefix to a more frequent irregular verb (e.g. a-venir, a-tener, con-decir, con-mover...) and many highly infrequent lexemes in general, barely in use in the speech community (e.g. abnegar, ablandecer, amoblar, amodorrecer...).

Rappaport Hovav 1995), constructionalist (e.g. Goldberg 1995), or
syntactic (e.g. Borer 2005) share the assumption that verb meanings
decompose into an event template defining the broad temporal and
causal structure and an idiosyncratic root filling in real world
details about the event. While it is a common assumption that these
two classes of meanings are ""bifurcated"" (Arad 2005, Embick 2009,
Dunbar & Wellwood 2016), so that templatic meaning is only introduced
by the template and never by the root, this question has never been
put to empirical test. This paper examines the semantic and
morphological predictions of this hypothesis focusing on the roots of
change of state verbs and derivatives of them. It shows that there are
two distinct classes of roots --- roots from which descriptively
deadjectival verbs are derived (the ""flat"" class) and roots from which
descriptively monomorphemic verbs are derived (the ""crack""
class). Contradiction tests, sublexical modification, and
circumstantial evidence from morphological typology show that while
the former class behaves consistent with bifurcation, the latter does
not; instead the roots themselves seem to carry an entailment of
change of state, otherwise a templatic entailment. A formal analysis
assuming this is provided that explains the different behavior of the
two root classes. Thus the conclusion is that contrary to bifurcation,
some roots do introduce templatic meaning, consistent with independent
findings that there are entailments of possession in the roots of some
ditransitives (Beavers & Koontz-Garboden 2016) and causation in the
roots of manner of killing verbs (Beavers & Koontz-Garboden
2012). This is ultimately argued to be a consequence of the nature of
certain kinds of idiosyncratic root meanings, which may entail some
templatic meanings as inescapable parts of their definitions.","['change of state verbs', 'root meaning', 'lexical decomposition', 'deverbal adjectives', 'sublexical modification', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2016

From a compositional perspective, the 'so' in 'sogenannt' will be reasoned to be identical in function to quotation marks as a means to refer to a linguistic shape through demonstration.

But the outer limits of this domain remain out of sight, at least in Northern Paiute. Verb suppletion exhibits an intervention effect: the trigger must be the closest possible trigger.

We attribute the effect to the compound status of the German constructions as well as their morphological origin, in contrast to the syntactic source of the French constructions.

The morphemes making up locative pronouns such as Dutch daar/German da ‘there’, and place adpositions (e.g. German auf, ‘on’) are shown to pronounce different parts of the aforementioned clausal structure.

Focusing on the syntactic and especially semantic side, we suggest that these methods could help clarify five questions: (i) what morphology and syntax, if any, do monkey calls have? (ii) what is the 'lexical meaning' of individual calls? (iii) how are the meanings of individual calls combined? (iv) how do calls or call sequences compete with each other when several are appropriate in a given situation? (v) how did the form and meaning of calls evolve? We address these questions in five case studies pertaining to cercopithecines (Putty-nosed and Blue monkeys, Campbell's monkeys), colobinae (Guereza and King Colobus monkeys), and New World monkeys (Titis). The morphology mostly involves simple calls, but in at least one case (Campbell's -oo) we find a root-suffix structure, possibly with a compositional semantics. The syntax is in all clear cases simple and finite-state. With respect to meaning, nearly all cases of call concatenation can be analyzed as conjunction. But a key question concerns the division of labor between semantics, pragmatics and the environmental context ('world' knowledge and context change). An apparent case of dialectal variation in the semantics (Campbell's krak) can arguably be analyzed away if one posits sufficiently powerful mechanisms of competition among calls, akin to scalar implicatures. An apparent case of non-compositionality (Putty-nosed pyow-hack) can be analyzed away if one further posits a pragmatic principle of 'urgency', whereby threat-related calls must come early in sequences (another potential case of non-compositionality – Colobus snort-roar sequences – might justify  assigning non-compositional meanings to complex calls, but results are tentative). Finally, rich Titi sequences in which two calls are re-arranged in complex ways so as to reflect information about both predator identity and location are argued not to involve a complex syntax/semantics interface, but rather a fine-grained interaction between simple call meanings and the environmental context. With respect to call evolution, we suggest that the remarkable preservation of call form and function over millions years should make it possible to lay the groundwork for an evolutionary monkey linguistics, which we illustrate with cercopithecine booms, and with a comparative analysis of Blue monkey and Putty-nosed monkey repertoires.  Throughout, we aim to compare possible theories rather than to fully adjudicate between them, and our claims are correspondingly modest. But we hope that our methods could lay the groundwork for a formal monkey linguistics combining data from primatology with formal techniques from linguistics (from which it does not follow that the calls under study share non-trivial properties, let alone an evolutionary history, with human language).","['primate linguistics', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'monkey semantics', 'monkey linguistics']",2016

I suggest that ergative extraction construction in Gitksan involves a nominalisation construction as a alternative to the (illicit) movement of a transitive subject. One piece of evidence for this claim is that the morpheme involved in agent extraction constructions (an) is also a nominaliser. I also present new evidence that a similar construction is utilised in Gitksan to ‘fix’ otherwise illicit long-distance extractions from clauses that attach as adjuncts.

We suggest that more primitive syntactic notions underlie the descriptive label oblique, specifically that of an elementary relator with a part/whole content. Thus the DP embedded under a genitive case/adposition is interpreted as a possessor/whole with respect to a local superordinate DP (the possessum/part). We argue that case/agreement stacking corresponds to the presence of a partial copies of this second argument within the phrasal projection of the relator. In section 2 we apply this analysis to linkers, using Albanian as a case study; we then go on to case/agreement stacking in Punjabi (section 3) and in the Australian languages (e.g. Lardil), which are often taken as the core instantiation of the phenomenon.","['agree', 'oblique case', 'case stacking', 'linkers', 'adnominal modifiers.', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2016
Failure to control is not a failure: it’s pro,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002987/current.pdf?_s=adKmY2ugWkHdZn3l,"['McFadden, Thomas', 'Sundaresan, Sandhya']","Whenever two related grammatical elements display distinct properties and appear in distinct environments, we have in principle two analytic possibilities: (i) the Inherent View: posit distinctions inherent to the elements themselves, leading to them having different distributions; (ii) the Derived View: posit a single underlying element with a broad distribution, with distinctions arising from the different contexts in which that element appears.

One place where this analytic tension is played out is in the analysis of non-overt subjects in different contexts, i.e. in obligatorily controlled (OC) “PRO” and (little) “pro”. Although, on the surface, the two elements — both silent, pro-forms and occuring typically in subject position — have a great deal in common, we can discern both distributive and interpretive distinctions once we dig a little deeper. OC PRO yields sloppy readings under vP ellipsis, is obligatorily coreferent with a local antecedent and yields obligatory de se readings in attitude contexts. Little pro may be negatively defined with respect to each of these diagnostics. Distributionally, OC PRO seems universal and is the subject of a prototypically non-finite clause; but pro may be the subject or object of a finite clause and is famously parametrized.  It is probably safe to say that it is standard to take an Inherent approach to this distinction (e.g. Chomsky 1982, Martin 2001, Hornstein 1999, Landau 2004, 2013), with PRO treated as being essentially anaphoric and pro treated as being fundamentally pronominal. There have, however, been a number of Derived proposals (e.g. Borer 1989, Manzini 2009, Kissock 2014, Duguine 2015, Fischer 2015).

The goal of this paper is to argue for a version of the Derived view. In particular, we will empirically motivate the idea that OC PRO, NOC PRO and pro correspond to distinct interpretations of a single underspecified nominal pro-form, ""UPro"", that arise based on what UPro Agrees with in the course of the derivation and to language-specific rules of realization that then apply. Crucially for us, Agree is fallible in the sense of Preminger (2014), thus failure to Agree yields a substantive result, and not a crash.","['pro(-drop)', 'pro', 'obligatory control', 'non-obligatory control', 'finiteness', 'fallible agree', 'fallible control', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2016

Both agent extraction and long-distance extraction from adjunct clauses are characterized by a pre-predicative morpheme an and a dependent clause remnant (contra intransitive subject and object extraction). I suggest that an, which is also a productive nominalizer in Gitksan is appearing in these constructions as a ‘fix’ for otherwise illicit extraction of ergatives, as well as from adjunct clauses. This can provide a piece of counter-evidence to a recent claim that head-marking languages cannot have extraction restrictions (Deal 2016).

Adjuncts, such as depictive predicates, are interpreted as conjuncts, as is commonly assumed. The standard assumption about complements is that their interpretation is by function application, where the specifics are then determined by the semantics of the selecting head. Here it is proposed that there is a common interpretive core to complementation, one which is monotonic and in some abstract sense mereological. This applies both to extended projections and to complements which are embedded in another extended projection, and is exemplified by resultatives as well as other secondary predicate types. The interpretation is monotonic in the sense that the selecting head preserves the interpretation of the complement, elaborating on it. It is mereological in the related sense that the complement is interpreted as an integral part of the interpretation of the whole.

Such claims raise questions about the degree to which identity conditions on ellipsis are sensitive to syntax. This paper reviews the literature on non-isomorphic sluices, presents new evidence for such cases, and concludes that identity conditions in sluicing must, at least, be blind to syntactic differences between copular Wh-questions and their non-copular antecedents. An important challenge to such a view comes from case-matching effects in sluicing (Ross 1969). Copular Wh-arguments in sluices, in many languages and contexts, differ in case from their antecedent correlates. Given case-matching, we expect such sluices to be unacceptable. I show that an empirically motivated characterization of case-matching is compatible with a view that allows (non-isomorphic) sluiced copular clauses. In short, abstract Case is irrelevant in sluicing, and instead, morphological case is what matters. In languages that mark case on remnants, case must match with the correlate (e.g., German, Russian, Greek), but in languages that do not (e.g. Brazilian Portuguese, English, Spanish), abstract Case need not match. One consequence, is that ellipsis of copular clauses is available in many instances, and not others, with cross-linguistic consequences about when and where we expect non-isomorphic copular sluices to be available.",['698 times'],2016

Three main components of the dissertation involve applicative structures, definite articles and morphophonology. I argue for the existence of applicatives in noun phrases which do not include a verbal substructure based on the realization of morphemes in an Icelandic Caused Experience construction. A study which compares definite articles in German and Icelandic supports the findings in Schwarz (2009) that there are two definite articles in natural language and the realization of the Icelandic articles has implications for the theory of suffixation under adjacency (Embick and Noyer 2001). These case studies, in addition to a series of smaller case studies, support the view that an analysis of one linguistic component may only be well-informed if it considers other interacting components as well. My method, to approach a well-defined empirical case, Icelandic nouns, with a precise theoretical framework like Distributed Morphology, yields valuable results. I show how many types of locality constraints interact in the same word and this is pleasing because it shows that the theory is not based on convenient but cross-linguistically isolated data sets. Rather, aspects of language like syntax, morphology and semantics are constantly interacting and they are best understood in the context of each other.","['distributed morphology', 'dp', 'noun phrase', 'icelandic', 'applicatives', 'suffixation', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2016

The paper argues that this approach simplifies the syntactic analysis of Dutch verb clusters. The upshot of the analysis is that since auxiliaries undergo verb-second, verb movement must be a postsyntactic operation, as suggested by Chomsky (2001).",['395 times'],2016

Proxy control: a new species of obligatory control under modality,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002901/current.pdf?_s=7FigCPvA4ldmbBG_,"['Doliana, Aaron', 'Sundaresan, Sandhya']","The goal of this paper is to present evidence from Brazilian Portuguese (BP), German, Italian, and Tamil for a hitherto unobserved species of obligatory control (OC) that obtains only in the scope of deontic modality, which we term ""proxy control"". Formally, proxy control involves a non-exhaustive obligatory control relation between one set of individuals i and another, f (i), that is discourse-contextually related to it. It thus bears a clear connection to proxy readings reported in the realm of anaphora (Jackendoff 1992, Lidz 2004 Reuland and Winter 2009) though the nature of the proxy relationship is fundamentally different in both. We show, furthermore, that the environments that license proxy control are a proper subset of those that license partial control, another non-exhaustive obligatory control dependency. A central question that arises with respect to non-exhaustive control dependencies like partial and proxy control, given that these are discourse-contextually conditioned, is whether their treatment should be relegated entirely to (LF-)semantics or to discourse-pragmatics. Here, we provide novel evidence showing that proxy control can feed phi-agreement on floating quantifiers and secondary predicates in Brazilian Portuguese and Italian to argue that part of the proxy control dependency must be (morpho-)syntactically instantiated. The theoretical implications of these findings are potentially far-reaching. In addition to widening the typology of possible obligatory control dependencies in natural language, proxy control also poses a strong challenge to movement theories of control (e.g. involving a null comitative PP containing the controller in the controlled constituent, as in Boeckx et al. 2010, a.o.). We propose a preliminary analysis of the proxy control facts in terms of Landau (2015b)’s “logophoric” control, suggesting in particular that the mediating perspectival C head in the control complement encodes a species of deontic modal (Mod_deontic): this captures the property that proxy control only obtains in the scope of deontic modality, just as desired.","['proxy control', 'deontic modality', 'obligatory control', 'partial control', 'proxy anaphora', 'control shift', 'reference', 'phi-agreement', 'brazilian portuguese', 'german', 'italian', 'tamil', 'syntax', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2016
Root-based Syntax and Japanese Derivational Morphology,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002918/current.pdf?_s=1IUseDd-6UBBENhJ,"['de Chene, Brent']","Published proposals that paired intransitive and transitive verb stems in Japanese (nao-r- ‘get better’, nao-s- ‘make better’) are syntactic constructions of root plus little v (Volpe 2005, Harley 2012, Marantz 2013) rest empirically on a database (Jacobsen 1992, Volpe 2005) that consists entirely of such transitivity pairs.  The procedure for root identification assumed by those proposals thus involves only pairwise examination of verbal stems, disregarding both stems of other lexical categories and verbal stems outside the transitivity pair.  Relaxation of these constraints, which have no principled basis, reveals that a significant minority of Japanese verb stems in fact display sequences of two transitivity-determining suffixes (yuru- ‘slack (adj.)’, yuru-m- ‘slacken (intr.)’, yuru-m-e- ‘slacken (tr.)’; nezi ‘screw’, nezi-r- ‘twist (tr.)’, nezi-r-e- ‘get twisted’).  

The recognition of sequences of transitivity-determining suffixes allows us to test the hypothesis that those suffixes are syntactic elements by examining how they interact with each other.  When this is done, we find that, in sharp contrast to what is observed with uncontroversially syntactic elements like auxiliary verbs, an outer transitivity suffix must be taken to render an inner one inert for purposes of semantic interpretation and argument structure.  A parallel argument is provided by the interaction of the verbal suffix -m- and the adjectival suffix -si-:  voiding of the properties of the inner element is again observed, along with the added complication that the order in which those two suffixes occur is an idiosyncratic function of the individual root.  A final argument against taking the combination of root and transitivity suffix to be a syntactic construction is the diachronic instability of the putatively compositional interpretation thereof; I consider in particular the case of causative -s-.  In conclusion, I briefly consider the choices available for alternative modes of characterizing the knowledge that speakers have about the semantic and morphological relations among stems.",['635 times'],2016

On the basis of two vocalic alternations, namely vowel zero alternations in verbal prefixes and roots and alternations in vowel length in roots and theme suffixes, I show that the perfective verbal stem represented by a linear string prefix root theme is parsed into three prosodic constituents, [prefix root], [root theme] and [prefix root theme]. These prosodic domains correspond to three syntactic constituents: VP and a lower and higher projection of the theme suffix respectively. The crucial point of the syntactic analysis is that the prefix undergoes phrasal movement: it is generated next to the root in VP and when the theme is added, it moves to its specifier. In the [prefix root] constituent, the vocalization pattern of the prefix is established. The constituents comprising theme suffixes are prosodic domains in which a general rule (called the infinitival template) operates; this rule in effect lengthens underlying long vowels in monosyllabic infinitives.","['syntax-phonology interface', 'verbal stem', 'prosodic template', 'vowel length alternations', 'vowel-zero alternations', 'czech', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2016

The primary focus is on deriving the Accusative Subject Generalization (ASG), the generalization that accusative subjects are never related thematically to a morphologically intransitive verb. After it is demonstrated that the ASG holds, it is proposed that the ASG follows from the claim that there is no such thing as inherently case-marked accusatives in Icelandic. The accusative subject constructions under scrutiny in fact involve a silent external argument that distributes like a clitic syntactically and is interpreted like a weather pronoun semantically. The account is explanatory insofar as it involves one stipulation—the presence of a silent clitic—from which the ASG and numerous other syntactic, semantic, and morphological properties of accusative subject constructions follow. The explanatory value of the account hinges on a grammatical architecture where morphological idiosyncrasy and semantic idiosyncrasy are computed in distinct components of the grammar, and case marking—even structural case marking—is divorced from DP licensing.","['case-marking', 'dependent case', 'accusative case', 'fate accusatives', 'quirky case', 'oblique subjects', 'icelandic syntax', 'weather verbs', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2016

In this paper I take a look at a classic problem in Spanish morphosyntax,
namely the alternation between the forms -se and -ra in the Imperfect Subjunc-
tive (Imperfecto de Subjuntivo). Research on this topic has mainly focused on
sociolinguistic variation, and has been done almost exclusively with impression-
istic data and speaker’s intuitions. I address the problem from a usage-based
perspective, using corpus linguistics methods. The main claim is that the choice
between -se and -ra correlates to a certain extent with morpho-syntactic and
discourse factors. Through collostructional analysis I also show that there are
repelled and attracted collexemes that distinguish and relate both forms.","['se ra', 'imperfect subjunctive', 'spanish', 'ndl', 'alternation', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2016

affix marks the head of a possessive noun phrase and appears on roots expressing
property concepts. This pattern has been argued to be semantically motivated by
Koontz-Garboden and Francez (2010). This paper discusses two constructions of Ulwa
that do not receive a natural treatment in their analysis, potentially casting doubt on the
plausibility of a se- mantic motivation for the syncretism. We provide a modified version
of the analysis, in which property concept roots denote mereologically ordered sets of
portions of substance (in the spirit of Link's 2002 treatment of mass nouns), as argued
for in Francez and Koontz- Garboden (2014), rather than property theoretic ones.
Possessive relations are then taken to include mereological ones. Such an analysis not
only retains the motivation for a semantic approach to the syncretism, but also
strengthens it, by showing that the range of interpre- tations available to the allegedly
possessive affix is one expected of possessive lexemes more generally.","['property concepts', 'possession', 'gradability', 'mass nouns', 'predication', 'mereology', 'syncretism', 'morphosemantics', 'ulwa', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2016
Catalan vowel epenthesis as evidence for the free ride approach to morphophonemic learning,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004218/current.pdf?_s=JXD6BQt1EJnXZ0A9,"['Lloret, Maria-Rosa', 'Pons-Moll, Clàudia']","Although the discovery of underlying representations (URs) is a complex
task that may be conditioned by various factors (see, e.g., Albright
2002), it has traditionally been claimed to be quite straightforward
when the UR is revealed by productive and transparent morphophonemic
alternations and when there is a clear and regular phonological
condition in the language that justifies the disparities between the
presumed UR and the corresponding surface representation. Among
other possible scenarios (see, e.g., Albright 2008, Kager 2008, Pater
et al. 2012), uncertainty appears when these morphophonemic alternations
do not exist, when they are not fully productive and transparent,

the case of the URs of words beginning with ""esC-"" in Catalan, which
we discuss here.

The purpose of this squib is twofold. On the empirical side, we
provide new arguments for the epenthetic nature of the vowel in ""esC-""
words, arising from the interaction between potential word-initial
vowel epenthesis and underapplication of vowel reduction
(VR) in Majorcan Catalan. On the theoretical side,
we show how Majorcan Catalan learners take a ""free ride"" (McCarthy

involving ""esC-"" initials by generalizing the pattern--and the subsequent
input-output mapping--observed in cases with transparent morphophonemic

Featural Variables,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002128/current.pdf?_s=cbH7fNLkgMGT_Zxc,"['Schlenker, Philippe']","A long line of research takes some sign language loci to be the overt realization of variables. Kuhn 2014 argues that this analysis fails in two cases. (i) First, loci sometimes appear to be inherited through agreement rather than directly interpreted, in particular in those environments in which phi-features are known to remain uninterpreted (= 'Kuhn's Generalization'). (ii) Second, there are cases in which one and the same locus can refer to different individuals, in contradiction with the predictions of the standard theory. Kuhn concludes that sign language loci are an open class of features rather than of variables; and he provides a variable-free treatment of them, although without accounting for their deictic uses. While granting the correctness of Kuhn's Generalization, we offer an alternative in which loci are both features and variables: some loci (in particular deictic ones) obtain their value from an assignment function, and introduce presuppositions on the value of other (covert) variables; but loci are also subject to the same rules of agreement as phi-features, and thus remain uninterpreted in other environments. Finally, we argue that spoken languages also have expressions that are featural while also containing a variable element.

Explaining Mainland Scandinavian Gender,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002801/current.pdf?_s=7E8NeT-r3gYRtVBL,"['Josefsson, Gunlög']","Examining the gender systems in Mainland Scandinavian, I argue that a strict division has to be made between three dimensions of gender: formal gender, semantic gender, and lexical gender. Lexical gender is a salient meaning component of a noun; this dimension of gender is syntactically inert. Semantic gender is a category of thought, basic to human cognition, and conveyed by pronominal resources. Examples of semantic genders are masculine, feminine, countable, non-countable, animate, and non-animate. Formal gender is – synchronically – phonology and thus syntactically inert. This means that there is no Formal Gender Phrase or the like in the syntactic tree. The three dimensions are clearly separate, but they interact, and the pronominal forms associated with the different dimensions are sometimes identical, which blurs the picture.
The formal gender features have basically the same status as the phonological features of a root. Thus, formal gender does not carry any inherent meaning, but may be used for the spell-out of semantic distinctions, for example animate – inanimate. Of particular importance is the idea that neuter is used in Mainland Scandinavian to spell out the absence of number, which accounts for neuter agreement on so-called pancake sentences. A pragmatic effect is that neuter in such contexts corresponds to non-countability. In adjectival agreement, however, formal gender is more or less ornamental. Agreement on adjectives is a phonological wellformedness criterion, and if no other source to agreement is available, agreement will be in formal gender.
Drawing on work done in the 80s (primarily Bosch 1983; 1986; Cornish 1983), I argue that it is necessary to distinguish between pronouns that refer to a linguistic entity, for example a DP, and pronouns that refer to a discourse entity. This is, in fact, what lies behind they properties of hybrid nouns (Corbett 1991), which are cases where the two ways of making reference make use of different pronominal forms. For Swedish the pronouns den (3C) and det (3N) are carefully discussed in this study. It is shown that these pronouns can be used as Syn-pronouns, that is for reference to noun phrases, where the head nouns are formally common gender or neuter, but also as Ref-pronoun, to make reference to countable or non-countable discourse entities.
The analyses are based on Mainland Scandinavian, but an outlook is made to some related languages.",['592 times'],2015

Boyd & Goldberg (2011) had offered experimental evidence suggesting that the dispreference is learnable on the basis of categorization and statistical preemption: repeatedly witnessing predicative formulations in contexts in which the attributive form would otherwise be appropriate. The present paper addresses Yang (2015)’s counterproposal for how a-adjectives are learned, and his instructive critique of statistical preemption.  The counterproposal is that children receive evidence that a-adjectives behave like locative particles in occurring with certain adverbs such as far and right. However, in an analysis of the 450 million word COCA corpus, the suggested adverbial evidence is virtually non-existent (e.g., *far alive; *straight afraid). In fact, these adverbs occur much more frequently with typical adjectives (e.g., far greater, straight alphabetical). Furthermore, relating a-adjectives to locative particles does not provide evidence of the restriction, because locative particles themselves can appear as prenominal modifiers (the down payment, the outside world). The critique of statistical preemption is based on a 4.3 million word corpus analysis of child directed speech that suggests that children cannot amass the requisite evidence before they are three years old. While we clarify which sorts of data are relevant to statistical preemption, we concur that the required data is relatively sparsely represented in the input. In fact, recent evidence suggests that children are not actually cognizant of the restriction until they are roughly ten years old, an indication that input of an order of magnitude more than 4.3 million words may be required. We conclude that a combination of categorization and statistical preemption is consistent with the available evidence of how the restriction on a-adjectives is learned.","['statistical preemption', 'negative evidence', 'adjectives', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015
The interpretation of external arguments,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002487/current.pdf?_s=9kbeh-kDTCmLr_MF,"['Wood, Jim', 'Marantz, Alec']","The striking parallels across languages in the syntactic expression of “argument structure” broadly construed has led within generative grammar, at least since Generative Semantics, to generative theories that demand a kind of transparent reflection of argument structure in underlying syntactic representations. This trend is reflected in approaches oriented around thematic roles, such as those that adopt some version of UTAH, as well as event-structure oriented approaches like that in Ramchand 2008 in which, in a sense, event structure is underlying syntactic structure. An alternative approach attributes the relative uniformity of the expression of argument structure to the principles that interpret syntactic structure semantically; here, syntax is truly autonomous, with the atoms of syntactic representations and their relations carrying no semantic values. On this alternative approach, we might expect that the same meanings could be expressed by different syntactic structures and that the same syntactic structures might express different meanings.  

	In this chapter, we present an account of the heads that add participants to events.  Within current theories, these heads are usually identified as voice, appl, and prepositions, as well as little v for some linguists, where the causative little v head might introduce an agent or causer. We will follow Pylkkänen (2008), Harley (2013) and Legate (2014) among others, in arguing that little v does not, by itself, introduce an argument, so our account will focus primarily on the voice, appl, and prepositional heads. We will argue that syntactic heads crucially involved in the interpretation of argument structure – heads like v, voice, p and appl – are subject to contextual allosemy at the semantic interface such that each such head may have a particular range of meanings, including a null (expletive) meaning, depending on the syntactic context. Once syntactic heads are absolved from the necessity of carrying certain features relevant to their interpretation explicitly, when the features are rather computed contextually at the point of semantic interpretation, we can develop a sparse inventory of functional heads for the syntax.

Differential object marking in Hungarian and the morphosyntax of case and agreement,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005010/current.pdf?_s=UIiIOAtaBN9c0XRz,"['Bárány, András']","This dissertation deals with several related phenomena regarding the interaction of case and agreement across languages. The first part focuses on differential object agreement in Hungarian, where the finite verb always agrees with its subject and sometimes also agrees with the direct object. I argue that both the syntactic structure and the semantic properties of the object are crucial in determining differential agreement. In addition, the morphological realisation of agreement depends on the features of the subject and the object. In inverse configurations, the verb only spells out subject agreement in Hungarian. 

The second part puts the discussion of Hungarian object agreement in a cross-linguistic context. I argue that the phenomenon of “global case splits” represents a dependent-marking counterpart to inverse agreement. In global case splits, case-marking of the subject or the object of a sentence depends on properties of the both arguments, not just the argument that is case-marked (or not). Rather than spelling out an inverse marker (or nothing, as in Hungarian) in inverse configurations, the verb assigns a special case-marker to the one of its arguments in global case splits. Such global case splits represent instances of agreement feeding or bleeding case-marking rather than the other way round. I suggest that Case assignment and probing for phi-features are distinct processes, the order of which varies across languages. If Case assignment precedes phi-agreement, global case splits are ruled out; the order makes them possible.

Finally, I sketch aspects of a parameter hierarchy for agreement systems.

With the VP complementation approach, I assume that a restructur- ing complement contains a syntactically and semantically independent VP. In contrast to the bare VP complementation approach, however, I propose that restructuring complements also involve a voice head (but no embedded subject). Motivation for a voice head in restructuring comes from the subject interpreta- tion of the embedded predicate, German stem allomorphy, and voice marking in several Austronesian languages. This hybrid account has the advantage that argument structure ‘sharing’ only applies to the subject of a restructuring configuration, whereas the remaining argument and event structure properties of the matrix and embedded VPs remain separate, which is supported by cross-linguistic properties pointing to the morphological, syntactic, and semantic independence of the two VPs.

Though these halves in general match up, the values can be distinct or one can be missing altogether. Throughout the dissertation, I investigate various phenomena where the values of the two halves of the feature do not line up, looking at the mass/count distinction, collective nouns in (British) English, and quantified noun phrases in Russian, among others.

I look at agreement that targets the iF value of a feature instead of the uF, which leads to semantically motivated agreement, and I show that this has a different, more restricted behavior than morphologically motivated agreement, operating under different structural configurations. From this difference, I provide a version of Agree that can handle the differences between semantic agreement and morphological agreement. I also discuss the Agreement Hierarchy of Corbett (1979, et seq), where it appears to hold within a single sentence. I show that when two targets agree with a hybrid controller, the targets can mismatch with one agreeing with the iF and one with the uF. Not all mismatches are allowed, a fact that is explained through the timing of agreement.

Furthermore, I show how this view of features allows us to look at the mass/count distinction in a new light. I propose that two classes of atypical mass nouns - fake mass nouns in English and plural mass nouns in Telugu - result from there being a mismatch on the number features of the items, which results in the morphology of the noun having either mass or count behavior (depending on the language), whilst the semantics shows the opposite behavior.","['features', 'agree', 'agreement', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

property concept terms (Dixon 1982) on the form of predicative and
comparative constructions. We demonstrate the existence of two kinds
of property concept lexeme, which differ systematically in how they
participate in constructions expressing the truth conditions of
property concept predication. The first kind of lexeme is used in
canonical predicative constructions, the other in predicative
constructions which invoke possessive morphology or syntax. The
differences between the two classes are observable both within a
single language and crosslinguistically.  The paper argues that the
morphosyntactic differences in the behavior of the two lexeme types is
predictable from their lexical semantics. Specifically, we argue that
some PC lexemes denote mass substances (in a technical sense), and
therefore require possessive semantics to achieve the relevant truth
conditions.  A semantic theory for substance denoting lexemes is
developed, and a compositional analysis of the relevant constructions
is presented for Ulwa, an endangered Misumalpan language of Nicaragua.

We will consider a case-study, namely central and southern Italian vocatives, which are obtained by truncation, to show that: 1. Deixis and reference are to be kept separate. 2. Speech-act related information is encoded in syntax, but on a different dimension than core argumental syntax. 3. This dimension is targeted by prosody. 4. There would be no other way that grammar could be built, given the inviolable constraint imposed by prosody because of the fact that it cannot apply without underlying phonological segmental material.","['vocatives', 'deixis', 'referentiality', 'phi-features', 'truncation', 'prosody', 'southern italian', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2015
How Large Can Elliptical Arguments be in Japanese?,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002593/current.pdf?_s=XJRS6d-CLxBD3lJd,"['Sato, Yosuke']","This paper addresses the previously unexplored question of how large elliptical arguments can be in Japanese with special reference to Case. Evidence from the absence of the intervention effect exhibited by null objects in the context of genitive subjects in Japanese (Hiraiwa 2000; Miyazawa 2001; Saito 2004) as well as Case mismatches between antecedent and elliptic arguments (Oku 1998; Saito 2004, 2007) indicates that elliptical objects in Japanese do not need to check Case, a pattern which naturally falls out from the LF-copy Theory of argument ellipsis advanced in the recent literature on Japanese ellipsis (Oku 1998; Kim 1999; Saito 2007; Takahashi 2008a, b, 2014). However, I present novel data bearing on the interaction of the so-called Double-o Constraint (Harada 1973; Shibatani 1973; Kuroda 1978) with sloppy/quantificational interpretations of elliptic arguments (Oku 1998; Takahashi 2008a, b) to show that elliptical objects are actually Case-marked under certain syntactic circumstances such as causative constructions. To account for these apparently conflicting observations regarding Case under argument ellipsis, I propose that LF-Copy can apply freely either to an NP without Case or a KP with Case (Bittner and Hale 1996), with illegitimate derivational choices being ruled out by independently motivated LF constraints in Japanese.","['nominative-genitive conversion', 'transitivity restriction', 'double-o constraint', 'causatives', 'ellipsis', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

The phenomenon described by the EPP in fact turns out to be quite challenging from a theoretical standpoint, as its properties look countercyclic under standard Minimalist models of grammatical architecture. The constraint describing the relevant ill-formed structures requires reference to phonological information, yet the mechanism that typically avoids violations of this constraint, i.e. movement to subject position, bears all the hallmarks of being a syntactic operation. Thus it looks like we have a syntactic operation triggered by phonological considerations, which is countercyclic. A novel approach to the EPP is thus required, which can handle its sensitivity to phonological factors, yet still fits in with our broader theory.

It does so by testing the Huave dataset of Embick and Noyer (2007) which served to motivate  postsyntactic local dislocation. It develops an analysis in an antisymmetric framework with no postsyntactic rules, building on the results of Cinque’s 2005 work on Universal 20 patterns (patterns which generalize to other syntactic hierarchies (Cinque 2009). 
The local dislocation analysis is shown to have to take as its input a syntactic representation that must be rejected on Huave internal grounds as well as on universal grounds. The U20 approach is shown to yield the patterns of grammaticality and ungrammaticality directly on the basis of the primary evidence and an independently motivated hierarchy. The U20 approach further makes a prediction about what can vary (the data seems to be underdetermined as to the relative order of merge), and shows how  allowing the location of merge to vary, directly captures dialectal variation in morpheme orders of two Huave dialects.","['syntax', 'morphology', 'dm', 'local dislocation', 'antisymmetry', 'universal 20']",2015
Algorithmic Acquisition of Focus Parameters,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003006/current.pdf?_s=qx4K1hIaAQdFp79G,"['Bazalgette, Timothy']","This thesis connects two strands of inquiry. The first is an investigation into the form and determination of minimalist (Chomsky 1995) parameters, whose nature is uncertain compared to the well-defined principles and parameters approach of Chomsky (1981). One prominent approach (termed “lexicocentrism”) confines variation to the features of heads in the lexicon, which, though minimal, places a significant acquisitional burden on the learner, and appears to predict unstructured variation, despite typological and diachronic evidence to the contrary. Roberts & Holmberg (2010), Roberts (2010c, 2012 et seq.) suggest these problems may be resolved if structure is provided by domain-general learning principles, which combine to create emergent hierarchies of microparameters. I develop this suggestion in detail, proposing a domain-general algorithm for categorisation and feature assignment which is applied to a number of toy linguistic examples.

The second strand concentrates on a specific area of syntactic variation: that of focus expression. This area exhibits vast diversity, with structures not only differing significantly across languages, but also within them. Moreover, most previous attempts to describe these differences either fail to account for the full range of variation seen, or rely heavily on the notion of construction. I suggest that two components are necessary to break these constructions down into their constituent heads. Firstly, I take focus to be unified by the invocation of alternatives (Krifka 2007), and building on Rooth’s (1985, 1992, 1996) theory of alternative semantics, I argue that focus constructions may be described as an abstract relation between an expression and its alternatives. Secondly, a null hypothesis of compositionality allows these descriptions to shed light on syntactic structure. This approach is demonstrated for focus constructions in English, Nepali, ASL, LSB, and BSL, and the resulting analyses are shown to be acquirable by the domain-general algorithm, providing a new perspective on parameterisation.","['focus', 'parameters', 'hierarchies', 'recos', 'asl', 'bsl', 'lsb', 'nepali', 'english', 'alternative semantics', 'emphatic focus', 'focus doubling', 'contrastive reduplication', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2015

Domains on the Border: Between Morphology and Phonology,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002729/current.pdf?_s=393evSw4SAM6Tw81,"['Moskal, Beata']","In this dissertation, I show that a difference in structure between functional and lexical items has a restricting effect on both the morphology and the phonology. Morphologically, we observe two asymmetries: (i) in lexical nouns, number-driven root-suppletion is common whilst case-driven root-suppletion is virtually unattested; (ii) in contrast, pronouns commonly supplete for both number and case. By and large, we see the same pattern in verbs, observing a contrast between lexical verbs and auxiliaries with regard to suppletion for aspect and tense. In order to account for these asymmetries, I appeal to structural differences between lexical and functional material, combined with locality effects as proposed in Distributed Morphology (Halle & Marantz 1993). Crucially, lexical material contains a category-defining node which has a delimiting effect that causes case/tense to be insufficiently local to the root to condition its suppletion. In contrast, functional material lacks category-defining nodes and thus no delimiting effect is observed and case/tense are free to condition suppletion of the functional base. Phonologically, we see a correlation between the presence of a category-defining node and the absence of dominant prefixes in vowel harmony and lexical accent, whilst in the absence of a category-defining node dominant prefixes are attested. Thus, I argue for universal limitations on suppletion patterns and dominant prefixes, which crucially derive from a difference in morpho-syntactic structure between lexical and functional material.","['suppletion', 'distributed morphology', 'allomorphy', 'locality', 'phonology/morphology interface', 'vowel harmony', 'lexical stress', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2015

I propose that hard worker-type paradoxes, or verbal bracketing paradoxes, result from a process of rebracketing at LF, which can be seen as a type of movement. This movement, and indeed all movement, is constrained by a principle of Information Preservation, which ensures that certain aspects of structural information are not destroyed during movement.

We apply this proposal to triadic verb constructions, where the comitative/instrumental alternates with dative.

Together, the survey and case study results presented here show that the apparent differences that arise between phonologically-conditioned morphological and syntactic alternations can be attributed to locality and domain effects, of boundary size and of prosodic/segmental levels.

Spell-Out of Phonological Domains: The Case of Slovenian,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003031/current.pdf?_s=0kDvLw_3JomGRHtE,"['Bozic, Jurij']","Novo mesto Slovenian, a South Slavic language, exhibits a process of unstressed /i/-deletion that appears to be construction-specific: it applies in verbs and participles, but not in other word classes, such as nouns or adjectives under identical phonotactic conditions. This thesis proposes a phonological analysis of this deletion process, which determines that the masculine plural exponent /-i/ may attach to a participial stem, as in [ptc]-/i/, and undergo deletion under specific phonotactic conditions, but it may also attach to a nominal or adjectival stem, as in [adj]-/i/, where it is preserved in the same phonotactic conditions in which it deletes with participles. This process of construction-specific vowel deletion cannot be derived by the standard approaches to construction-specific phonology, such as Cophonology Theory (Orgun 1996; Inkelas et al. 1997; Inkelas & Zoll 2007; Inkelas 2008, 2011), or the grammar with phonological levels (Cyclic/Word/Phrase level) as in Embick (2013), which stems from Halle & Vergnaud (1987) and effectively mirrors Lexical Phonology (Kiparsky 1982a,b; Mohanan 1986). The problem is rooted in the way these approaches define phonological domains. A system with the fixed distinction between Cyclic and Word levels is shown to be inadequate. This thesis subscribes to the research program laid out in Marvin (2002), Marantz (2007), Samuels (2009), Piggott & Travis (2013) and Newell & Piggott (2014), which seeks to interpret the phasal cyclicity of syntax (Chomsky 2001, 2008) as a locality boundary that defines phono- logical domains. It is shown that a simple generalization on the /i/-deletion facts can be formulated by making reference to phases as phonological spell- out domains. In addition, this thesis proposes a tentative formal solution to the problem of deriving the deletion of the masculine plural /-i/: since the deletion effect is specified in the stem to which the /-i/ attaches, it is proposed that the phonological grammar stores phonology-specification in a buffer, which may persist to the end of the spell-out domain as set by the phase. Through this, the stem-specified deletion phonology effects the masculine plural suffix /-i/.","['construction specific phonology', 'distributed morphology', 'spell-out', 'phases', 'cyclicity', 'slovenian', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2015

With respect to word formation, the fact can be explained if the reduplicant is combined with a base first and then a functional element is merged with the combination, and the categorial features are projected from the functional element alone (categorization). Thus, not only roots, but also derivational affixes, can have no categorial features. As a consequence, the existence of acategorial plural markers indicates that number features can be integrated not only after categorization, realized as inflectional affixes or functional elements, but also before categorization, realized as derivational affixes.

The first concerns agreement restrictions or oddities on Romance pronouns and pronominal clusters, the second looks at some agreement facts in verb/argument structures, and the third one examines agreement restrictions/oddities within the DP.","['agreement', 'agreement restrictions', 'pcc', 'impersonal si', 'anti-agreement effects', 'romance', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015
Object Suffixes as Incorporated Pronouns in Seereer,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003311/current.pdf?_s=Fa1mILd9FSyHPO56,"['Baier, Nico']","In Seereer (Atlantic, Senegal), singular pronominal objects are obligatorily realized as an object suffix on the verb. This paper provides the first comprehensive description of this object suffixation pattern, a topic that has been only cursorily described in the extant literature on Seereer (cf. Renaudier 2012). In addition, I provide a preliminary theoretical account of the Seereer object suffix system. I argue that Seereer object suffixes are best analyzed as incorporated pronouns. Evidence for such an analysis comes from the following: (i) an object suffix may never occur with an in situ object DP; (ii) an object suffix may not double an extracted object in relative clauses, wh-questions, or focus constructions; (iii) there is only one object suffix allowed per clause; and (iv) an object suffix may reference either object in a double object construction. I argue that object suffixes raise to Spec-vP and are subsequently incorporated in the verb via m-merger (Matushansky 2006, Kramer 2014, Harizanov 2014). This analysis elegantly derives the behaviors listed above. Such an approach also allows us to integrate the Seereer object suffixation data into the broader understanding of cliticization patterns crosslinguistically, thereby enriching our understanding of object marking systems in verbs.","['clitics', 'agreement', 'pronouns', 'seereer', 'm-merger', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

The Nanosyntax of French Negation: A Diachronic Perspective,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002524/current.pdf?_s=Sf8VkPGgn8S2JrLy,"['De Clercq, Karen']","This paper presents a nanosyntactic account for negation in what is referred to as le bon usage French (Grevisse and Goosse [1936] 1993, Rooryck 2010) and in colloquial French.  The analysis captures the obligatory presence of ne and pas for the expression of sentence negation in le bon usage French, whilst also accounting for the loss of ne in colloquial French. The difference between ne and pas in le bon usage French boils down to a structural difference: ne consists of only one feature or syntactic layer, a polarity feature, whereas pas consists of four features, focus, degree, quantity and proper negation. Only the combination of these five features can yield what is conceived of as sentential negation. With respect to colloquial French the analysis involves that the syntactic structure of pas, encoded in a post-syntactic lexicon, starts spelling out five features, thus making ne redundant for the expression of sentential negation. Given that the use of negative markers in le bon usage French and colloquial French represents two important and well-described stages in what is referred to as Jespersen’s Cycle (Dahl 1979) this account is also relevant from a diachronic perspective.","['negation', 'nanosyntax', 'french', 'jespersen cycle', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

The discussion is set within the framework of a minimalist Context-linked Grammar, where phases contain silent but active edge features, edge linkers, including speaker and hearer features. An NP is phi-computed in relation to these linkers, the so established relation being input to context scanning (yielding reference). Essentially, syntax must see to it that event participant roles link to speech act roles, by participant linking (a subcase of context linking, a central computational property of natural language). Edge linkers are syntactic features–not operators–and can be shifted, as in indexical shift and other Kaplanian monster phenomena, commonly under control. The essay also develops a new analysis of inclusiveness and of the different status of different phi-features in grammar. The approach pursued differs from Distributed Morphology in drawing a sharp line between (internal) syntax and (PF) externalization, syntax constructing relations–the externalization process building and expressing items.","['edge linkers', 'pronouns', 'speaker', 'phi-features', 'context linking', 'context scanning', 'indexical shift', 'inclusiveness', 'bound variables', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015
Selection: Factivity and Interpretation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001786/current.pdf?_s=o_XfVSz3CevDOE8Z,"['Kastner, Itamar']","Work on the syntax-semantics interface has been at odds to explain two seemingly unrelated issues: factivity effects and the nature of clausal complementation. I show that we need look no further than basic selectional requirements: new data and generalizations from English, Hebrew, Greek, Persian and American Sign Language reveal a systematic difference between verbs of different kinds which reduces to whether they select for an entity (a DP) or a proposition (a CP).

I argue that some verbs select for a definite entity, translating into a CP embedded in a covert DP layer; and some select for a proposition, being simply a CP. The former are factive, the latter nonfactive. In addition, all verbs that select for a DP can embed a factive complement. A definite complement triggers not only factivity but also leads to differences in interpretation in a predictable manner, thus uniting the two issues of interest.

The resulting syntactic analysis of matrix predicates and embedded clauses feeds semantic and discursive effects, bridging assertions, presuppositions and referential propositions. It also allows us to account for additional, as-yet-unexplained generalizations such as the factivity and nominalhood of sentential subjects, correctly predicting when they would be nonfactive.","['selection', 'factivity', 'presupposition', 'cp', 'dp', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

‘Case’ thus potentially accounts for the distribution of (referential) DPs and motivates phenomena such
as A-movement (passivization, raising and, for some, Control). Recent proposals, however, have
argued for the parameterisation (Harford Perez 1985, Markman 2009, Diercks 2012) or rejection of

The morphosyntactic nature of definiteness opens the way towards a proper parameterization. We then thoroughly discuss the patterns of definiteness realization which indicate that the definite article starts low, as a suffix on the noun (as chiefly shown by the “low definite article” of Old Romanian identified by Cornilescu and Nicolae 2011a), and its (sometimes multiple) realization is driven by Agree.","['agree', 'definiteness agreement', 'polydefiniteness', 'licensing', 'low definite article', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

This chapter addresses three central issues for the understanding of morphological acquisition: the distributional properties of morphology, the mechanisms of learning from data, and the developmental patterns and trajectories in child language. First, corpus studies of child directed language reveal a systematic pattern of data sparsity: in general, only a (small) fraction of possible morphological forms will be attested in the acquisition data. The child learner, then, must be able to form wide ranging generalizations from early on, and on very partial corners of the morphological paradigm. Second, we review evidence from morphological development, especially the study of English past tense, and draw two broad conclusions: (a) morphologically complex forms appear not memorized by association but are learned in relation to their morpho-phonological classes, lexicalized or otherwise, and (b) as far as child language is concerned, morphological productivity appears categorical, where children often over-use productive processes but almost never commit analogical errors. Third, we situate morphological learning models in the context of language acquisition, where psychological considerations pose additional challenges and constraints. The child must proceed in an incremental and unsupervised fashion, which deprives them of assumptions (such as stem and derived pairs) that are taken for granted in theoretical analysis. Along the way, we discuss how language acquisition may provide useful insight for the theoretical study of morphology.","['language acquisition', 'corpus linguistics', 'computational linguistics', 'frequency effects', 'productivity', 'analogy', 'english past tense', 'morphology']",2015
Deriving prosodic structures [phd],https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002560/current.pdf?_s=FoB5eK06FjtOKrPI,"['Gunes, Guliz']","Deriving prosodic structures is devoted to explicating and exploring prosodic structure formation in relation to syntax. To achieve this, it compares and contrasts empirically attested prosodic constituency patterns of a number of syntactically diverse structures. By investigating parts of words, words, mono- and multi-worded phrases, root clauses, parentheticals, and structures employed as speech acts, this book presents a stepwise analysis of the procedure of mapping from syntax to prosody. It also provides an extended discussion of which syntactic structures correspond to which prosodic structures. Following the basic assumptions of Distributed Morphology and Match Theory, this book claims that only certain heads and projections of narrow syntactic structures (those with a phonological exponent) are mirrored in the prosodic constituency. It also argues that certain prosodic interface categories (e.g. prosodic words and certain intonational phrases) are not generated as the result of mapping from syntax. Rather, they emerge from conditions on prosodic well-formedness. To account for such cases of ‘mismatch’, a limited ‘indirect access’ account is endorsed, in which prosodic constituency is partially faithful to syntax, and the constituency is simplified as a consequence of applying the rules of the prosodic grammar, which is partly universal and partly language-specific.

Deriving prosodic structures is of interest to scholars working on the interfaces of syntax, morphology and prosody. It covers topics such as prosodic word formation, acoustic differences between phonological phrases and intonational phrases, the generation of prosodic (non)prominence, prosodic recursion and its absence, phonologically null morphemes and how they are represented in phonology, illocutionary force bearing structures, discourse level embedding of clauses, and the acoustic realisation and the syntactic behaviour of parenthetical structures.","['syntax-prosody mapping', 'parentheticals', 'prosodic grammars', 'turkish', 'tagalog', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2015

the types of diachronic factors that contribute to the rarity of a particular feature.
It is proposed that a number of different diachronic factors may play a role, such
as the rarity of source constructions, the rarity of particular types of change, the
number of stages necessary for a particular feature to develop, and the number
of pathways that can lead to a particular feature. This article looks at a rarissimum
of person marking, namely, a zero-marked feminine 2nd singular person
index in the Sahidic dialect of Coptic (Afroasiatic; Egypt). It is argued that such
markers are rare because they presuppose rare input structures, and most
processes of change would lead away from – rather than to – zero-marked 2SG.
Furthermore, this study identifies a diachronic process in which a PART of a
morpheme is reinterpreted as a segmentable morpheme (in this case, a person
index), thereby leading to the loss of a zero person marker. This is the converse
of the well-known “Watkins’ Law”, in which a segmentable person marker is
reinterpreted as part of a base.","['ancient egyptian-coptic', 'typology', 'diachrony', 'inflection', 'markedness', 'paradigm', 'person', 'rara', 'syntax', 'morphology']",2015

Doing so, I tease apart the notion of structural markedness and typological markedness. The results of this investigation show, as Cowper did, that plural is structurally more complex than plural; however, this does not imply that plural is typologically more marked than plural. Thus, the Nevins’ arguments that dual is more typologically marked than plural still hold, even though plural is structurally more complex than dual.

The morphosemantics of past tense,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002591/current.pdf?_s=vIJ5iubKLrKUAe00,"['Arregi, Karlos', 'Klecha, Peter']","This paper argues that the English Past Tense and (so-called) PerfectAspect are morphosyntactic variants of the same underlying operator.This is motivated by the old observation that Past Tense and thePerfect Aspect have, in English, two obvious things in common.  Thefirst is anterior-time semantics; both 'John left' and 'John has left'locate an event of John's leaving in the past with the respect to thetime of their utterance. The second observation is morphological; thelexical verbs in the two sentences above are inflected identically. Ofcourse, the challenge in pursuing this analysis lies in thenon-totality of these similarities.  While the Past and PresentPerfect are, truth-conditionally identical in some contexts, they aredistinct in others.  Additionally, for certain verbs, like 'eat', themorphology is not identical either.

This paper focuses on the morphosyntactic challenges that this accountfaces.  We argue that the present perfect consists of a Past Tensescoped over by a Present Tense; likewise the Past Perfect ('John hadleft') of two Past Tenses stacked, and perfects under modalauxiliaries ('John must have left') or in infinitival contexts aresimply instances of a Past Tense as well. After briefly outlining asemantics which can account for divergences like the one mentionedabove, we elaborate on the following morphosyntactic proposal: Pasttense requires that the verb after it bear an inflectional feature,which is spelled out as '-en', as in 'eaten'.  However, a verb whichcarries both this feature and a finiteness feature spells out as'true' past morphology, as in 'ate'; but these two forms are syncreticfor some verbs.  Finally, the presence of multiple functional heads inthe TAM domain (e.g., two tenses) can trigger feature conflict andtherefore dummy-verb insertion.  Since the finiteness feature whichtriggers true past morphology only appears on the highest verb in afinite clause, dummy-verb-insertion prevents this feature fromreaching the lexical verb.","['past tense', 'perfect', 'auxiliaries', 'verbal inflection', 'aspect', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

Since intransitive subjects do not appear with ergative marking, this straightforwardly accounts for the absence of ergative morphology. Crucially, such bifurcation is not specific to ergative languages; it is simply obfuscated in nominative-accusative environments because there, by definition, transitive and intransitive subjects pattern alike. The account also derives the universal directionality of splits, by linking the structure that is added to independent facts: the use of locative constructions in nonperfective aspects (Bybee et al. 1994, Laka 2006, Coon 2013), and the requirement that 1st/2nd person arguments be structurally licensed (Bejar & Rezac 2003, Baker 2008, 2011, Preminger 2011, 2014).","['ergativity', 'split ergativity', 'aspectual splits', 'person splits', 'syntax', 'morphology', 'dependent case', 'case', 'agreement', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

Here I argue that the polysynthetic Uto-Aztecan language Classical Nahuatl (CN) was actually configurational. I claim that unmarked VSO order was derived by verb phrase (vP) fronting, from a base-generated structure of SVO. A vP constituent is evidenced by obligatory movement of indefinite object NPs with the vP, as in pseudo noun incorporation analyses given for VOS order in other predicate-initial languages such as Niuean (Polynesian) (Massam 2001) and Chol (Mayan) (Coon 2010). The CN case is interesting to contrast with languages like Chol, which lack head movement, in that the CN word order facts show the hallmarks of vP remnant movement (i.e., the fronting of the verb plus its determinerless NP object into a position structurally higher than the subject), while the actual morphology of the CN verb shows the hallmarks of head movement (including noun incorporation, tense/aspect/mood suffixes, derivational suffixes such as the applicative and causative, and pronominal agreement prefixes marked on the verb). Finally, in regard to the landing site for the fronted predicate, I argue that the placement of CN’s optional clause-introducing particle ca necessitates adopting the split-Comp proposal of Rizzi (1997), as is suggested for Welsh by Roberts (2005). Specifically, I claim for CN that ca is the head of ForceP and that the predicate fronts to a position in the structurally lower Fin(ite)P.","['configurationality', 'polysynthesis', 'pseudo noun incorporation', 'noun incorporation', 'predicate raising', 'split comp', 'classical nahuatl', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

"What ""Spell-out"" reveals: Niger-Congo prosodification constrains the syntax-semantics interface",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002085/current.pdf?_s=N7-RQ3WNQ8oP3mTV,"['Dechaine, Rose-Marie']","The interaction of prosody — including both segmental and tone melody — with syntax and semantics in Niger-Congo languages has been extensively treated in phonological terms (Downing, 2006; J. L. Smith, 2011). This paper shows that approaching prosodification through the lens of syntax yields both empirical and theoretical benefits. Empirically, attending to the syntax of prosodification provides insight into the structure of the lexicon across the Niger-Congo language family. Most notably, it permits a formal account of the relation between regular and ideophonic vocabulary items. Theoretically, it forces a re-conceptualization of the prosody-syntax and prosody-semantics interface, as well as the syntax-semantics interface. In particular, it challenges one of the tenets of Distributed Morphology, namely that the entire lexicon is category-less (Embick & Marantz, 2008). More broadly, it also challenges the Saussurean dictate that the relation between form and meaning is always arbitrary. Finally, it confirms the architecture proposed in the model of Interface Syntax (Wiltschko & Déchaine, 2010), which correctly predicts that prosody can associate directly with syntactic or semantic atoms, namely both phono-syntactic (sound-category) and phono-semantic (sound-meaning) bundling is attested.","['bantu', 'benue-congo', 'category', 'ideophone', 'interface', 'lexicon', 'morphology', 'morphotactic', 'niger-congo', 'noun', 'phono-syntax', 'phono-semantics', 'phonotactics', 'prosody', 'root', 'semantics', 'tone', 'shona', 'stem', 'strata', 'syntax', 'verb', 'word-class', 'yoruba', 'minimality', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2015
Minimalism and the Design of the Language Faculty,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002305/current.pdf?_s=RMxabHShlVBthEGG,"['Mobbs, Iain']","This is ongoing work - all comments are gratefully received. 

The attached explores the cognition underlying the knowledge, use, and acquisition of human language – the faculty for language, or language faculty (FL). In particular, it examines the validity and utility of the set of related, but logically independent proposals comprising the argument of linguistic Minimalism (LM). These proposals define an atheoretic research program for linguistic enquiry – the Minimalist Program for Linguistic Theory (MP) (Chomsky 1993) – as well as introducing specific claims about the status of linguistic variation and the FL’s broader role in human cognition. 

Chapter 1 defends the existence of a coherent subject matter for ‘biolinguistic’ enquiry of this kind. 

Chapter 2 attempts to clarify those Minimalist proposals which comprise the MP, and to present their compulsory logic; it offers an explicit (if partial) framework for Minimalist research based around principles of algorithmic science. 

Chapter 3 argues for the validity of the substantive hypotheses of LM: in particular, it defends the largely ancestral nature of humans’ conceptual-intentional apparatus and proposes a particular characterization of permissible syntactic variation, introducing a novel analysis of discourse pro-drop as part of the argument. 

Chapters 4 and 5 examine the evidence for the implication of Minimalist notions of optimality and ‘interface conditions’ in the design of the FL. In doing so, these chapters offer new suggestions regarding the motivation for lexical categories, phase-based spell-out (Chomsky 2001), and structural Case. 

Chapter 6 focuses on the status of the parser in LM, suggesting that parsing relies heavily on computationally-optimized cognition and defending a close relationship between syntactic grammar and the parser. The chapter goes on to motivate a (limited) parsing-based account of the linearisation of abstract syntactic structure and to propose an explanation for the Final-over-Final-Constraint (Biberauer, Holmberg & Roberts 2014). 

Chapter 7 suggests that we think about language acquisition as based on parsing with an over-complete grammar, rather than as determining the settings of an under-specified, defective grammar. It is suggested that diachronic evidence of ‘conservative’ acquisition (including the prevalence of grammaticalisation, “featural economy” (Clements 2003), and the gradual relaxation of the contexts for phonological rules) plausibly reflects concern for optimality in the process of acquisitional parsing. On the other hand, the prevalence of analogical forces in language change is presented as the footprint of ‘liberal’, computationally-constrained data analysis, attested in acquisitional tasks across cognitive domains. 

Chapter 8 offers an account of the evolutionary origins of non-referential, conceptually “promiscuous” lexical meaning. Finally, I suggest that the machinery grounding lexical semantics also affords our capacity for metaphorical thought, our rich theory of others, and our solipsistic nature (sometimes called ‘the human condition’); I argue that the FL is even more intimately related with what it means to be human than already assumed.

Verb Stems in Jóola Eegimaa: Stem-internal movement and compositional interpretation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002494/current.file?_s=1QRVUKDcpfP1FORr,"['Safir, Ken', 'Bassene, Mamadou']","The agglutinative morphology of verb stems poses many problems for theory and analysis, insofar as distinct theoretical commitments as to what counts as a linguistic unit do not always align. The verb stem morphology of Jóola-Eegimaa ((Eegimaa, henceforth), an Atlantic language of the Niger-Congo family, poses just such a challenge.  We argue that our analysis, which relies on several operations that rearrange the underlying syntactic structure of the verb stem in Eegimaa, permits the various demands of syntax, semantics and morphology to receive a unified analysis for which there is striking empirical support. Insofar as the success of our analysis depends on core minimalist assumptions, our approach supports not just the minimalist approach in general, but also has implications for the copy theory of internal merge, for the typology of head movement, for the role of syntax in the derivation of words before surface morphological operations, for the nature of surface morphological operations, and for the compositional and de-compositional analyses and interpretation of the verbal spine. In particular, we make an existence argument for a form of stem-internal long head movement that any revealing analysis of Eegimaa verb stem structure will require. We also briefly explore the possibility that the operations that underlie stem-affixation and interpretation in Eegimaa may provide a window into some of the vexing morphosyntactic complexities found in other agglutinative languages.","['head movement', 'morphology', 'atlantic language', 'reduplication', 'african language', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

Primarily motivating this proposal are the syntactic similarities that we observe between comparative constructions and other adjunction structures in grammar. Specifically, we propose that comparative clauses adjoin to the extended projection of the NP or VP containing the comparative morpheme, and enter into an agreement relation with that morpheme. This agreement relation is the overt morphological reflex of the head of the comparative clause taking scope over, and semantically valuing an implicit argument introduced by the com- parative morpheme. We argue in detail that such a proposal is to be preferred over classic alternatives that posit a complementation rather than adjunction relation, such as Bresnan (1973) and Bhatt and Pancheva (2004).

Hacia una teoría de la identidad parcial en la elipsis (Toward a theory of partial identity in ellipsis),https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002436/current.pdf?_s=Wo72jeTbjRcK1yMO,"['Saab, Andrés']","The main claim in this dissertation is that copy deletion, null subjects and ellipsis form a natural class of phenomena, all being the result of a morphosyntactic operation: I-Assignment, a transformation that adds an Identity feature ([+I]) to phrases or heads. The PF effect of I-Assignment is blocking the Lexical Insertion rules that otherwise would automatically apply in the maximal domain of the morphological component: morphosyntactic words. The definition of this process is given in (1):
Non-Insertion:
(1)	No Lexical Insertion Rule, IR, applies in the domain of X0, X0 a MWd, if X0, or some projection of  X0, is specified with a [+I] feature.

I-Assignment -seen as the counterpart of F-marking- is triggered by a single formal identity condition and by some structural conditions that are either syntactic or morphological. Identity is defined as a formal condition on abstract features and Roots. So, it is just strict syntactic identity. I-Assignment applies in an all the way fashion. Concretely, it can apply at every point of the derivation from syntax to PF. At syntax, I-Assignment affects phrases under syntactic conditions such as selection or c-command, whereas at morphology I-Assignment affects heads (morphosyntactic words in Embick & Noyer’ 2001 terms) under the same conditions that restrict affix hopping and other post-syntactic displacements (e.g., adjacency). The rationale behind this system is that there are no independent morphosyntactic configurations licensing ellipsis. 

I will claim that competing theories of ellipsis have to be evaluated with respect to their descriptive power for covering a broad set of apparently unrelated phenomena. I will show then that, in this regard, a cyclic theory of ellipsis with focus on the syntax/PF interface is able to provide an explicit answer to questions regarding the grammatical conditions that regulate (non)-pronunciation, the objects that can be affected by ellipsis, and the set of deducible interactions among such silent objects and other morphosyntactic phenomena. Among other set of problems, the I-Assignment system, I argue, derives (a) why a copy or a potential “null subject” has to be pronounced, even when identity is satisfied, (b) why in some cases, but not in others, agreement feeds ellipsis, (c) why phrasal copies, but not head ones, can obviate the identity condition on ellipsis, (d) why partial identity exists (e.g., vehicle change and morphological sloppy identity) and (e) why there are cases of movement in ellipsis structures that are not attested in non-elliptical contexts.","['ellipsis', 'identity', 'licensing', 'copy theory of movement', 'null subjects', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

Second, the insertion analysis fails to capture a generalization about hiatus resolution whereby vowel sequences undergo deletion, shortening, long vowel formation, or diphthong formation in a set of morphologically unrelated environments. The deletion analysis relies on the notion of preservation of the marked (de Lacy, 2006) and utilizes an independently motivated stratal organization of Apurucayali phonology in accounting for restrictions on verbal stems. The proposed analysis has important implications for the typology of epenthesis.","['epenthesis', 'insertion', 'coronal consonant', 'markedness', 'optimality theory', 'preservation of the marked', 'ajyiininka apurucayali', 'axininca campa', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2015
Negative Knowledge from Positive Evidence,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002414/current.pdf?_s=VpvYrxJSrkcF-1N5,"['Yang, Charles']","Why can’t we say “the asleep cat”? There is a class of adjectives in English, all of which start with a schwa (e.g., afraid, alone, asleep, away etc.), that cannot be used attributively in a prenominal position. A frequently invoked strategy in language acquisition research is indirect negative evidence. For instance, if the learner consistently observes paraphrases such as “the cat that is asleep”, then the conspicuous absence of “the asleep cat” may be a clue for its ungrammaticality (Boyd & Goldberg 2011). In this article, we provide formal and quantitative evidence from child directed English data to show that such learning strategies are untenable. However, the child can rely on positive data to establish the distributional similarities between this apparently idiosyncratic class of adjectives and locative particles (e.g., here, over, out, etc.) and prepositional phrases. With the use of an independently motivated principle of gener- alization (Yang 2005), the ungrammaticality of attributive usage can be productively extended to the adjectives in questions.","['language acquisition', 'indirect negative evidence', 'distributional learning', 'corpus linguistics', 'exceptions', 'computational linguistics', 'constructions', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

The paper finishes with the discussion of the distribution of the endings -i/y and -e as  the markers of the Dative and Locative in one of the declension classes in Polish.

Clauses with evidential marking present, but do not assert, an ORIGO-centered proposition. This presentative hypothesis makes a number of claims. Syntactically, clauses with presentative force are a distinct clause-type, and so contrast with declaratives, interrogatives, and imperatives. Semantically, clauses with presentative force contribute not-at-issue propositional content (Potts, 2007): they are independent of descriptive content, they hold of the ORIGO’s utterance situation, and they are perspectival. Pragmatically, evidential clauses update the ORIGO GROUND, and so interact in predictable ways with the COMMON GROUND, the QUESTION SET, and the TO-DO-LIST. Because of their ORIGO index, presentative clauses overlap with indexicals (if the ORIGO is 1st/2nd person) and with logophors (if the ORIGO is a 3rd person matrix subject). We test these claims with data from English, Nuu-chah-nulth, and Plains Cree, and show that several diagnostics reveal the existence of the ORIGO GROUND, including grounds for endorsement/challengeability, ORIGO shifts, and faultless disagreement. Consequently, languages don’t really differ in whether they have grammaticized evidential morphemes.

Readjustment: Rejected?,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002454/current.pdf?_s=RTr_RApPBHiC1jrO,"['Haugen, Jason D.']","Since the establishment of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993), readjustment rules have been a central tenet of the theory. Readjustment is a post-Lexical-insertion phonological operation triggered on certain Vocabulary Item by some aspect of the morphosyntactic context (e.g. a vowel change on a noun Root like mouse, triggered either by the [PL] feature of Num0 or  the null affix exponent inserted to express the [PL] feature of Num0, to yield an output of mice). This process-based aspect of a syntacticocentric theory is quite odd, however, given DM’s otherwise “piece-based” (Item-and-Arrangement) orientation. Various DM practitioners seem to have adopted readjustment as a necessary evil, even while bringing to the fore its problematic aspects; see, e.g. Harley and Noyer’s (2000:133) observation about stem suppletion, that any theory that could allow radical stem readjustments (e.g. deriving worse from bad) “could presumably do anything”; and Embick and Halle’s (2005:60)  piece assumption (where, “all other things being equal, a piece-based analysis is preferred to a Readjustment Rule analysis when the morpho-syntactic decomposition justifies a piece-based treatment”). Some recent work in DM (see, e.g., Siddiqi 2006, 2009; Bermúdez-Otero 2012; Bye & Svenonius 2012; Haugen and Siddiqi 2013; Kilbourn-Ceron et al. this volume, etc.) has called into question the necessity of readjustment rules, and a variety of different approaches can perhaps indeed obviate them. The purpose of the present paper is to raise the metatheoretical question of whether or not readjustment (i.e. the alteration of stem phonology after lexical insertion) is needed for any morphological theory. The conceptual and empirical domains investigated here include: (i) the employment of readjustment rules as “secondary exponence” phenomena; (ii) verb stem allomorphy in the Uto-Aztecan languages Hiaki (Yaqui) and Classical Nahuatl; and (iii) verb stem allomorphy concurrent with reduplication in the Oceanic language Sye (Erromangan). The most cogent argument in favor of readjustment rules over stem-listing approaches invokes the frequent phonological regularity of stem alternants (e.g., Harley and Tubino Blanco’s 2013 analysis of stem form alternations Hiaki). I adopt an alternative analysis whereby such regularities can be just as felicitously explained by appealing to historical linguistic processes rather than to readjustment rules applying in the synchronic grammar. This discussion thus falls under the purview of what Kiparsky (2006) has described as an “amphichronic program for linguistic theory”.",['1867 times'],2015

Initial parameters determine the distribution of this inherent case across instances of little v in a given language, sensitive to various thematic features, and subsequent dependent parameters determine further properties of ergative-assigning vs such as the presence of a movement trigger and the suppression of structural Case features. This gives rise to a number of distinct ergative types depending on (i) the distribution of ergative case, (ii) the presence/absence of syntactic ergativity and (iii) the source of absolutive case in transitive contexts. The resultant parameter hierarchy serves to restrict the space of variation, modelling a number of proposed implicational universals in this domain, and provides a potential solution to the subset problem in acquisition by encoding a notion of relative markedness. The dependencies (rankings) between the parameters in question, it is argued, stem from a version of the Case Filter, and the need to create convergent derivations. (Descriptively) all transitive thematic heads have the ability to assign a structural Case as a default (generalised Burzio’s generalisation) but this possibility can be switched off, for principled reasons, where the head in question both (a) assigns a thematic (inherent) case and (b) bears an EPP movement trigger.","['ergative', 'inherent case', 'parameter hierarchy', 'parametric theory', 'syntactic ergativity', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

Stress falls on the restrictive modifier, which is in the same NP with the head and is branching because of implicit alternative modifiers. Stress does not fall on non-restrictive modifiers, which are the specifier of Nominal Phrase (NomP) dominating the NP containing the head noun at the bottom of the whole structure. Then, we can keep generalized stress rules that apply to all types of phrases and compounds. Finally, I suggest the possibility of deriving the generalized stress rules from Restrictive Stress.

A cross-linguistic correlation between unagreement and the structure of adnominal pronoun constructions suggests that the availability unagreement depends on the independent syntactic representation of person and definiteness (Greek emeis *(oi) foitites vs. Italian noi (*gli) studenti ‘we (the) students’). It is argued that unagreement results from null spell-out of a head hosting person features high in the extended nominal projection of the subject. In languages with pronominal determiners, encoding both person and definiteness on the same head, a general restriction on silent definite determiners also restricts null spell-out of person features to otherwise silent nominals. This analysis provides a principled explanation for the cross-linguistic distribution of unagreement and suggests a unified framework for deriving unagreement, adnominal pronoun constructions, personal pronouns and pro.","['unagreement', 'subset control', 'pronominal determiners', 'person mismatch', 'nominal structure', 'modern greek', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2015

Morphological analyses approach the phenomenon as a case of syncretism between ergative and nominative in 1st and 2nd person; all transitive subjects are assigned an identical syntax. Syntactic analyses posit a featural or structural distinction between 3rd person subjects and 1st and 2nd person subjects, or the clauses containing them. On the basis of modification and coordination patterns, I argue that person-based split ergativity in Nez Perce requires a syntactic analysis. Comparison of the Nez Perce data with recent findings by Legate (2014) reveals variation among languages showing person-based split ergativity: some languages require a morphological analysis, and some (like Nez Perce) require a syntactic analysis.

A clause’s temporal specification is canonically located (and interpreted) on the highest head of the VP projection.

bound morphology). The framework employed succeeds in providing analyses of the verbal systems of the two languages which are both simple and explanatory.

More specifically, I show that derivational affixes have lexical meaning and that they are an open class, which defines them as [+lexical]. Yet, they obligatorily select a complement, which makes them [+functional]. They may or may not determine the category of their functional superstructure, which renders them [+/-categorial].

When a magician says 'Pick a card', context favors an interpretation where any card from the set would be a felicitous choice, as long as it is a card from the proposed set, as illustrated for modern Breton (Continental Celtic) in (1)a. Some indefinite constructions have this free-choice reading as the only felicitous one. This paper closely investigates such a free choice indefinite (FCI) that presents a typologically unusual morphology as illustrated in (1)b. 
 This free-choice indefinite is realized by reduplication of the head noun around what seems like a spatial proximate deictic morpheme (-mañ-). The relevant contrast with the regular indefinite 'ur gartenn' in (1)a is loss of optionality for the free-choice reading. The sentence in (1)a is felicitous if the magician proposes only one card,  whereas (1)b is not.

Next, I investigate the distribution of the Breton reduplicated FCI. I show that when preceded by a specificity marker, this construction behaves like a regular indefinite. When not preceded by this specificity marker, the noun exhibits the typical distributional restrictions of dependent indefinites.

Sluicing and Identity in Ellipsis [PhD thesis],https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002230/current.pdf?_s=V2YLxpo3qT0ltqFG,"['Barros, Matthew']","This thesis is concerned with sluicing, the ellipsis of TP in a Wh-question leaving a Wh-phrase “remnant” overt. Sluicing is subject to an identity condition that must hold between the sluiced question and its antecedent. There is currently no consensus on whether this condition should be characterized as syntactic or semantic in nature, or whether a hybrid condition that makes reference to both semantic and syntactic identity is needed (Merchant 2005, Chung 2013, Barker 2013).

I provide a new identity condition that captures extant syntactic generalizations while allowing for enough wiggle room to let in detectible mismatches between the antecedent and sluice. The identity condition I propose is “split” between two sub-conditions, one that pertains to the relationship between the sluiced Wh-phrase and its correlate in the antecedent (the Remnant Condition), and one that pertains to the sluiced question as a whole (the Sluice Condition). The Split Identity hypothesis counts as a hybrid identity condition. The Remnant Condition is novel, and requires that the remnant have a syntactic correlate in the antecedent with which it matches semantically. Split Identity is shown to capture the data motivating extant syntactic generalizations. The Sluice Condition requires that the sluiced question and the Question under Discussion (QuD) that the antecedent makes salient seek the same answers, and is an implementation of QuD-based approaches to the semantic condition on sluicing (Ginzburg and Sag 2000, AnderBois 2011).

The Split identity condition also lets in “pseudosluices” alongside isomorphic sluices, where the sluiced question is a cleft or a copular question while the antecedent is not. Pseudosluicing has often been proposed as a last resort mechanism, only available when an isomorphic structure is independently ruled out (Rodrigues et al. 2009, Vicente 2008, van Craenenbroeck 2010). I defend a view where pseudosluicing is not a special case of sluicing, so that the identity condition should not distinguish between copular and non-copular clauses in the evaluation of identity. Split Identity achieves this in making no reference to the syntactic content of the ellipsis site.","['sluicing', 'ellipsis', 'identity', 'isomorphism', 'clefts', 'copula', 'pragmatics', 'questions', 'answers', 'congruence', 'focus', 'case', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2014

Finally, Tagalog and Dutch loanwords can contain non-native segments, except when certain affixes are present. We account for these phenomena in a new constraint-based framework, Lexical MaxEnt with regularization factors. In this framework, constraint weights are rescaled for exceptional morphemes, and some affixes carry regularization factors that reduce or cancel rescaling. We argue that regularization is a property of morphemes rather than whole words, and that it follows from how these morphemes are combined in the grammar rather than from whole-word storage in the lexicon.","['morphology', 'phonology', 'exceptions', 'loanwords', 'lexical accent', 'lexical stress', 'dominance', 'distributed morphology', 'maximum entropy', 'maxent', 'russian', 'slovenian', 'japanese', 'dutch', 'tagalog', 'turkish']",2014
The Role of Case in A-Bar Extraction Asymmetries: Evidence from Mayan,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001401/current.pdf?_s=BHA_8sQCoAQLDjRt,"['Coon, Jessica', 'Mateo Pedro, Pedro', 'Preminger, Omer']","Many morphologically ergative languages display asymmetries in the extraction of core arguments: while absolutive arguments (transitive objects and intransitive subjects) extract freely, ergative arguments(transitive subjects) cannot. This falls under the label “syntactic ergativity” (see e.g. Dixon 1972, 1994, Manning 1996). Extraction asymmetries are found in many languages of the Mayan family, where in order to extract transitive subjects (for focus, question, or relativization), a special construction known as the “Agent Focus” (AF) must be used. These AF constructions have been described as syntactically transitive and semantically dyadic, because they contain two non-oblique DP arguments, but morphologically intransitive because the verb appears with only a single agreement marker and takes an intransitive status suffix (Aissen 1999, Stiebels 2006). In this paper we offer a proposal for (i) why some morphologically ergative languages exhibit extraction asymmetries, while others do not; and (ii) how the Mayan AF construction circumvents this problem. We adopt recent accounts which argue that ergative languages vary in the locus of absolutive case assignment (Aldridge 2004, 2008a, Legate 2002, 2008), and propose that this variation is present within the Mayan family. Based primarily on comparative data from Q’anjob’al and Chol, we argue that the inability to extract ergative arguments does not reflect a problem with properties of the ergative subject, but rather reflects locality properties of absolutive case assignment in the clause. We show how the AF morpheme -on circumvents this problem in Q’anjob’al by assigning case to internal arguments.","['case', 'ergativity', 'extraction', 'q’anjob’al', 'chol', 'mayan', 'agent focus', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2014

Default Ergative,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002221/current.pdf?_s=blj2Rkg0jwjd8X2L,"['Imanishi, Yusuke']","In this thesis, I propose the hypothesis that ergative Case in certain languages may be assigned to a DP which would be otherwise Case-less within a certain domain. In this sense, ergative Case appears to be a default. At the same time, I argue that ergative Case may be assigned by any phase head to the highest Case-less DP within its Spell-Out domain (= henceforth phase head Case) – it is not just a default. This gives rise to the impression that assignment of ergative Case is a default, though it is in fact structurally determined.

One of the crucial consequences of this approach is that ergative Case can be aligned with grammatical relations more flexibly than in previous approaches. Ergative may look like an ‘alignment’ because in the majority of sentences the subject in a transitive sentence is aligned with ergative Case. I argue that appearances are deceiving, and that if we look carefully at the full range of instances in which ergative is found, a different generalization emerges. I demonstrate that what is called ergative may constitute phase head Case in certain languages. There is no a priori reason to posit a correlation between ergative Case and grammatical relations – a DP receiving ergative Case could be either subject or object.

In this thesis, I investigate (split) ergativity in Mayan languages (mainly Kaqchikel, Chol, Q’anjob’al and Ixil) as a testing ground for the plausibility of the hypothesis that phase head Case exists, and is the correct analysis of certain phenomena generally analyzed as instances of ergative alignment.

Case and Agree in Slavic Numerals -Valuation of Features at the Interfaces within a Phase-Based Model,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002066/current.pdf?_s=jwVh1zYZt0bLwFR7,"['Kosta, Peter']","The Quantification of Nominal phrases in Slavic is one of the most analyzed but also still a poor understood and controversial point of discussion in both traditional descriptive and generative studies. Numeral phrases in Polish and Russian, as in other West and East Slavic languages, exhibit puzzling behavior. In particular, to judge by the morphosyntax of the constituents of the numeral phrase, the internal structure of the phrase appears to depend upon the external context of that phrase. The problem is a well-known paradox of Slavic syntax, and a considerable literature has been devoted to it. The purpose of this paper, which complements other work by Babby (1987), Franks (1995), Kosta (2008), Rappaport (2002), (2003) and Rutkowski (2006), is to develop a Minimalist theory of formal features, case syncretism, and lexical representation which effectively removes the paradox by maintaining (despite appearances) the usual independence of internal phrase structure and external context, while placing the morphosyntactic variation where such anomalous facts belong: in the lexicon and to the interfaces.
In the first part, I shall try to give a short overview of the puzzle concerning all the problems of case, number assignment and agreement in numeral and numerative constructions in Russian and Polish. In the second part, I shall try to give the solution to some problems so far unresolved, namely in which connection Agreement and Case assignment are driven by interface conditions of either PF (SM) or LF (CI) in the new approach of Strong Minimalist Thesis (Chomsky 2005). The patterns of Case assignment will be analyzed under the notion Agree and Feature checking within the descriptive generalization of so called heterogeneous vs. homogeneous paradigm. This section tries to refine the analysis of “heterogeneous” vs. “homogenous” morphosyntax of numeral expressions making use of recent syntactic developments, namely the emergence of the case-assigning mechanism Agree. The key insight is taken from Gilbert Rappaport’s approach on case assignment (2002), refined and enriched by the mechanism of interpretability and valuation of features from the recent studies on the Syntax of Valuation and the interpretability of Features developed by David Pesetsky and Esther Torrego (2004).",['v1 [April 2014]'],2014

I focus on their word-internal distribution in roots and affixes and their behavior under reduplication, showing that both have a very limited distribution and arguing that a different analysis is appropriate for each. I argue that /h/ is a consonantal phoneme (as is usually assumed), and claim that its deletion from the coda of the base under reduplication may be a consequence of backcopying to match its codaless reduplicant. Such would be consistent with other backcopying-like reduplicative morphology in the language, such as templatic backcopying to a syllable in the “abbreviated” class of reduplication (Caballero 2006). Glottal stops, on the other hand, are limited to following the first vowel in all contexts. I make the novel claim that these consonants appear as floating root features rather than underlying consonants, following Macaulay and Salmons’ (1995) proposal for similar facts in Mixtec. Guarijío laryngeals provide important sources of evidence for different aspects of comparative Uto-Aztecan historical phonology, so these synchronic analyses help form a firmer basis for future work in historical reconstruction.","['laryngeal consonants', 'glottal stop', 'reduplication', 'backcopying', 'guarijío', 'uto-aztecan', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2014

I suggest that the object of the gerundival verb may undergo scrambling to a position above negation, while the subject becomes a derived possessor on the surface.

Opaque Interactions of Merge and Agree: On the Nature and Order of Elementary Operations,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002129/current.pdf?_s=be9Ek5YhdUqnWenC,"['Georgi, Doreen']","In this thesis I explore opaque interactions of Merge and Agree in order to gain insights into the nature of elementary operations and their mode of application (simultaneous vs. sequential, extrinsic vs. intrinsic ordering). I investigate a configuration in which the Cycle does not predict an order among operations, i.e. in which a single head triggers both Merge and Agree. I argue (i) for more fine-grained elementary operations, in particular for a distinction between different types of Merge because they can apply at different stages of the derivation relative to Agree, and (ii) for extrinsic ordering of the operation-inducing features on a head. I investigate the  configuration in which a single head triggers more than one operation because the Cycle is too weak to make any predictions about the order of operations. The effect in (i) becomes visible when Merge is interleaved with Agree: Empirical evidence suggests that Merge can apply both before and after Agree within a single language because it can feed / bleed Agree and also counter-feed / -bleed Agree: Merge > Agree > Merge. This symmetric order cannot be derived if, as assumed in recent literature in transparent interactions, there is a language-specific parameter that simply orders Merge relative to Agree.  Based on the order where Agree “splits up” the Merge operation I show that we need to distinguish between final and intermediate movement steps (two types of internal Merge), external vs. internal Merge, and movement type-specific final and intermediate movement steps. The first distinction is motivated for interactions of Merge with upward and downward Agree. The empirical basis are reflexes of movement, which I take to be the result of a feeding interaction of Agree and internal Merge. I identify four patterns of reflexes  and argue that variation is best analysed as a consequence of reordering of operations on a head: Movement steps that apply before Agree can feed or bleed Agree; those that apply after Agree have the opposite effect, i.e. they counter-feed/-bleed Agree. The ordering approach presents the first uniform analysis of these patterns; in addition, it can  account for multiple reflexes and optionality of reflexes. I argue against alternative enriched representations analyses of opacity for empirical and conceptual reasons (incompatibility with Minimalist assumptions and modern theories of movement). Given that the approach crucially relies on timing (only a single operation can apply at any given stage of the derivation), it provides strong evidence for a strictly derivational model of grammar. In addition, I argue on the basis of the cross-linguistic variation that (i) final and intermediate movement steps in a long movement dependency are triggered by different features, (ii) that long movement always applies successive-cyclically even if we do not see a reflex of movement in all intermediate landing sites, (iii) that Agree applies in the syntax and is not a post-syntactic operation, and (iv) that the timing of edge feature discharge must be more flexible than proposed in the literature.","['rule interactions', 'extrinsic vs. intrincis ordering', 'merge', 'agree (upward vs. downward)', 'movement', 'edge features', 'locality', 'derivation vs. representation', 'successive-cyclic movement', 'patterns of reflexes', 'wh-agreement', 'case splits', 'anti-agreement', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2014

Each component has an antecedent in nature: E as found, for example, in birdsong, and L in, for example, the alarm calls of monkeys. E and L integrated uniquely in humans to give rise to language. A challenge to the Integration Hypothesis is that while these non-human systems are finite-state in nature, human language is known to require characterization by a non-finite state grammar. Our claim is that E and L, taken separately, are in fact finite-state; when a grammatical process crosses the boundary between E and L, it gives rise to the non-finite state character of human language. We provide empirical evidence for the Integration Hypothesis by showing that certain processes found in contemporary languages that have been characterized as non-finite state in nature can in fact be shown to be finite-state.

On our analysis, these are not borrowed suffixes and derivational patterns, in the sense that they were present in another language and got copied into S-C, but rather suffixes and patterns which emerged within S-C, more specifically in the Latinate stratum of the S-C lexicon. In other words, we argue that members of these two classes of nominalizations were first borrowed as simplex words.  After demonstrating that the sequences -cija and -itet display quantitative patterns characteristic of the productive native suffixes, we argue that these quantitative effects, in conspiracy with the shared semantic properties of the nouns ending in these sequences, have led to a reanalysis of the initial simplex borrowed forms as derived nouns involving a stem and the suffix -cija or -itet, respectively. Pragmatic, phonotactic and prosodic constraints apply to these derivations to the effect that the suffixes that have emerged in the borrowed domain of the lexicon never enter a competition with the native nominalization patterns.","['latinate nominalizations', 'borrowing', 'paradigms', 'serbo-croatian', 'quantitative analysis', 'productivity', 'syntax', 'phonology', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2014

Están sentados en la mesa --> Ha dicho que1 los invitados #(que2) están sentados en la mesa). QRC is an evidence for the existence of two types of complements for assertive verbs: quotative complements (embedded speech acts with a de dicto interpretation) and reportative complements (speech events that are stated, with a de re interpretation; e.g. Sp. Están sentados en la mesa --> Ha dicho que1 los invitados (#que2) ya están en su sitio).

Persistence in the Production of Linguistic Variation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002185/current.pdf?_s=amKOzGKn4u8StPRi,"['Tamminga, Meredith']","This dissertation, which is situated in broad debates over the delineation of abstract grammatical knowledge from the use of language in context, argues for distinct but interacting contributions from grammatical, psychological, and social factors in the production of intraspeaker linguistic variability. The phenomenon under investigation is the tendency of speakers to repeat recently-used linguistic options in conversational speech, which I refer to as persistence. I take up three major themes: the use of persistence as evidence on the mental-representational unity of variable linguistic processes; the interaction of different loci of variation with different cognitively-rooted facilitatory effects; and the contextual sensitivity of persistence to both social and grammatical expectations.

The core results of this dissertation are based on data from 122 interviews drawn from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Corpus (Labov and Rosenfelder, 2011). I argue for distinct phonological and morphological processes in the production of the common morphophonological variables ING (working/workin'), TD (old/ol'), and DH (them/dem/'em), with morphological variation showing generalized persistence while phonological variation is persistent only under conditions of lexical repetition. Specifically, I propose that verbal and nominal ING constitute distinct variables, as do past tense and monomorphemic TD, and that the alternation between stop and continuant consonants in DH is morphological in nature. The quantitative decay profiles of these variables, I suggest, tie their phonological versus morphological loci to their representation in episodic versus abstract memory systems.

Although the driving force behind persistence, in this view, is the operation of various general cognitive processes, I further argue that these processes reflect speakers’ sociolinguistic awareness in a way that supports a holistic expectation-based view of persistence asymmetries. The quantitative results and new questions in this dissertation set the stage for continued progress toward an integrated model of how social, grammatical, and psychological forces contribute to the production of linguistic variation.","['variation', 'persistence', 'psycholinguistics', 'morphology', 'phonology', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2014
Morphological Alternations at the Intonational Phrase Edge,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001485/current.pdf?_s=TYJw3QXY-Bf6C2fw,"['Henderson, Robert']","This article develops an analysis of a pair of morphological alternations in K’ichee’ (Mayan) that are conditioned at the right edge of intonational phrase boundaries. I propose a syntax-prosody mapping algorithm that derives intonational phrase boundaries from the surface syntax, and then argue that each alternation can be understood in terms of output optimization (Mascaró 2007; Mester 1994). The important fact is that K’ichee’ requires a prominence peak rightmost in the intonational phrase, and so the morphological alternations occur in order to ensure an optimal host for this prominence peak. Finally, I consider the wider implications of the analysis for the architecture of the syntax-phonology interface, especially as it concerns late-insertion theories of morphology (Anderson 1982, 1992; Embick and Noyer 2001; Halle and Marantz 1993; Hayes 1990, among others). The primary result is that late lexical insertion must occur at least as late as the construction of intonational phrases.","['syntax-prosody interface', 'morphology', 'mayan languages']",2014
Iconic Features,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001808/current.pdf?_s=r2Jz7nAqXQ66NBmX,"['Schlenker, Philippe']","Sign languages are known to display the same general grammatical properties as spoken languages ('Universal Grammar'), but also to make greater use of iconic mechanisms. In Schlenker et al., to appear, it was argued that  loci (= positions in signing space corresponding to discourse referents) can have an iconic semantics, in the sense that certain geometric relations among loci (subset and relative complementation, as well as high/low position relative to the signer) are preserved by the interpretation function. Here we ask whether plural and height specifications of loci display the formal behavior of phi-features in remaining uninterpreted in focus- and ellipsis-constructions (as in the bound readings of Mary admires herself, and John does too,  and of Only Mary admires herself). Data from ASL and LSF show that plural and height specifications may indeed remain uninterpreted in these constructions; furthermore, there are cases in which a single high locus is construed iconically and left uninterpreted in the course of ellipsis resolution. We argue that our data are compatible with two theories. According to the Strong View, plural and height specifications of loci display exactly the behavior of spoken language features. According to the 'Weak View', our data just show that plural and height specifications share the behavior of features and other non-assertive elements in being separable from the referential terms they specify. Our LSF data are compatible with the Weak View; our ASL might provide support for the Strong View. While we only aim to open the debate about the featural status of iconic specifications, the question is of some importance: if features are innate and primitive elements of grammar, and if some of them have an intrinsically geometric semantics, the signed modality might play a greater role than is usually thought at the very core of Universal Grammar.","['sign language semantics', 'iconicity', 'features', 'ellipsis', 'focus', 'universal grammar', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2014

We will put forth the thesis that clitics are procedural elements whose function is to license the presence of their associates and provide the semantic interface with instructions as to how to manipulate those sortal associates. Our argumentation will take elements from formal syntax (Radical Minimalism) and semantics-pragmatics (Relevance Theory) to configure an interface-based approach in which no phenomenon is studied in substantive isolation, but taking into account the interaction between different components of the system. Our aim is to provide prospects for a unified theory of the syntax-semantics of clitics, drawing on data from Spanish to support our theoretical claims.","['radical minimalism', 'relevance theory', 'clitic doubling', 'spanish', 'case marking', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2014

This paper presents new evidence in favour of Bartos’ (2001) analysis of anaphoric possessives, which holds that -é is the Genitive case.

C-omission is restricted to [-realis] clauses in Old as well as in Modern Italian, and to some types of declarative clauses in Modern Florentine (Cocchi & Poletto, 2005). This phenomenon is instead much more pervasive in the Renaissance period (Wanner 1981, Scorretti 1991) and invests basically all types of subordinate clauses. The present study concentrates on C-omission in Renaissance Italian relative clauses, which is attested in both subject and non-subject extractions. There is an asymmetry in the frequency of C-omission in subject/non-subject relative clauses, which is analyzed as the result of the combination of the active/inactive alignment that characterizes both Old and Renaissance Italian, and the loss of V2. The active/inactive distinction is attributed to the presence of a strong (*) feature on the low-phase head, Voice*, whereas the loss of V2 results from a parametric change on the higher phase head: from Fin* to Fin. The argument is corroborated by further comparative facts from Old Occitan and Old French.","['diachronic syntax', 'morphosyntax', 'voice', 'finiteness', 'relative clauses', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2014

This paper tackles individual level variability, building a minimalist type theory that allows us to capture this aspect of linguistic variation. The proposal builds on the idea that self-Merge can only be ruled out by stipulation, and removal of this stipulation allows unary branching structures into our system. I propose that these unary branching structures take the place of functional sequences, reserving binary Merge for specifiers (and hence recursion), and that they also (following Brody 2000) provide us with insertion loci for spellout. Within such a system, one is able to capture both parametric variation (as a property of which labelled functional sequences remain after acquisition) and individual level variability, as the underdetermined insertion of phonological material into these sequences.

Semantic non-transparency in the mental lexicon: On the relation between word-formation and naming,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001923/current.pdf?_s=4GgQfCHxPYev2lPg,"['Härtl, Holden']","In this paper, the interplay between semantic compositionality and the supposed naming function of word-formation products is investigated. Specifically, I will focus on the question of how these factors relate to the perceived novelty or ""markedness"" of newly formed compounds. For the analysis, we will concentrate on novel adjective-noun compounds, e.g., 'Blauschachtel' ('blue_box'), 'Schmalmesser' ('slim_knife') etc., with occasional glances at noun-noun compounds where relevant. We will start from a lexicalist perspective and the conventional assumption that, in German, word-formation is the preferred route for establishing a concept's name, put this assumption to several tests and prove it to be correct. In the second part of the paper, I will argue that a systematic relation holds between the markedness of an A-N compound and its interpretation as a kind name as well as its affinity to be lexicalized. Crucially, this relationship will be traced back to a pragmatic principle, which holds that deviance from a conventionalized form (that is, in our case, from a phrasal expression like 'schmales Messer' ('slim knife') implies deviance from the meaning of this form – which, in turn, results in a re-interpretation as a kind name and in semantic specialization. Consequently, interpretation as kind name and semantic specialization in compounds will be characterized as the cause for potential lexicalization and not as its effect, as is often proposed in the literature. Some remarks about the compatibility of the proposed analysis to alternative, non-rule-based approaches (e.g., Construction Grammar) will conclude my paper.","['compound', 'transparency', 'naming', 'kind', 'lexicalization', 'semantic specialization', 'conversational maxim', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2014

The perfect participle paradox: Some implications for the architecture of grammar,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002032/current.pdf?_s=I71tgsmIYnxl7lS7,"['Breul, Carsten']","The topic of this paper can be exemplified by the final clause of the following attested sentence: 'I don't know how he found out that she belonged to that lass, but find out he has'. Clauses like this one show a preposed verb phrase that is headed by a plain verb whereas the non-preposed verb phrase of their canonical counterparts is obligatorily headed by a perfect participle (i.e. 'he has {found / *find} out)'. This peculiarity of verb phrase preposing, which will be referred to as the perfect participle paradox, has seldom been discussed. The paper starts by showing that clauses that manifest the paradox are more frequent in the Corpus of Contemporary American English and in the British National Corpus than their non-paradoxical analogues with preposed canonical perfect participles. The paper then looks at the paradox from the point of view of generative syntax, discusses and rejects previous analyses, and argues that a solution of it entails the rejection of two assumptions that have been associated with a lexicalist position, especially by proponents of distributed morphology. These are the assumptions that a) a syntactic terminal is an item supplied by the lexicon and comprising a phonological representation and b) that syntax may not manipulate the internal structure of syntactic terminals. The paper proposes an analysis that is not based on these assumptions, but argues that the analysis does not entail the superiority of a distributed morphology framework.","['english', 'verb phrase preposing', 'perfect participle', 'passive participle', 'impoverishment', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2014

Regarding argument-realizing –er-nominals, we observe an idiolect split in which some speakers allow the full range of argument structures permitted by head movement analyses, while less liberal idiolects require a (lexicalistinspired but syntactically implemented) analysis where –er is a Voice head that selects V°, forcing arguments of V to merge above affixation as arguments of nouns, which is

Haugen 2003 proposes that CVC reduplication is dependent upon the syllable structure of the verb (an onset consonant of the second syllable of a verb stem cannot serve as a coda in a reduplicant), but Harley & Leyva 2009 regard CVC reduplication as copying CVC roots. This paper demonstrates that neither approach is fully adequate to account for all cases of syllabic reduplication in Hiaki. Rather, Hiaki grammar references both roots (morphological constituents) and syllable structure (prosodic constituents) for different classes of reduplication. Prosodic base-dependence at the level of the syllable is typologically rare but not otherwise unattested in syllabic reduplication.","['hiaki (yaqui)', 'reduplication', 'prosodic targets for reduplication', 'syllable copy reduplication', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2014
Modular PIC,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001993/current.pdf?_s=OqHcYtYQ9DPbjUMD,"[""D'Alessandro, Roberta"", 'Scheer, Tobias']","Domains of phonological computation, i.e. strings that are computed by phonology in one go, can be identified in two ways: derivationally and representationally. In earlier models of the architecture of grammar, the former is carried out by cyclic derivation or by levels in Lexical Phonology; under current theories it is achieved through strata in Stratal Optimality Theory or phases. In the representational approach, phonologically relevant chunks are expressed as juncture phonemes in structuralism, as hash marks (#) in SPE, and, since the early 1980s, as prosodic constituency (Prosodic Word etc.) 
Since SPE, both ways of defining chunks have been considered to be compatible, and since the development of Prosodic Phonology in the early 1980s, the division of labor has been roughly defined by word size: cycles determine domains below the word level, while prosodic constituents delineate domains of word size or larger. That is, roughly, Lexical Phonology can handle strings of morphemes but cannot identify larger units because postlexical phonology is non-cyclic. Strings of words are therefore structured by prosodic constituency. 
If phase theory is on the right track, this division of labor must be wrong: the very essence of phase theory is to define items that are bigger than the word, and to send them to PF (and LF). Against this backdrop, our first goal is to show that there can only be one chunk-defining device: theory cannot afford to have the same work done twice. 
The second goal of the paper follows on from this idea. As it stands, phase theory is unable to describe all phonologically relevant chunks, as these are too small and too diverse to be delineated in the current working. In order to qualify as the only chunk-defining device in grammar, phase theory needs to be made more flexible: in other words, it needs to be adapted to the demands of phonology.

The interpretation of Possessives in both languages can be related to a universal thematic hierarchy distributing semantic roles between prenominal Possessives and postnominal Genitives. However, although Czech and English structures are rather similar, there are specific formal distinctions between the two, which limit their usage. Then, the languages apply comparable strategies to disambiguate and compensate for the specificity of their respective Possessives. I show that as a result of the formal distinctions in the constituent characteristics in the two languages, semantically and functionally adequate equivalents may be realised using distinct (but predictable) formal means.","['english possessive', 'czech possessive', 'postnominal genitive', 'of-genitive', 'double genitive', 'thematic hierarchy', 'nominal arguments', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2014
The Phonological Basis of Latin Case Patterns,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003556/current.pdf?_s=dbc2DrSX4dwgibAF,"['Emonds, Joseph']","
This study focuses on accounting for allomorphy in Latin case/number inflection. It attributes essentially all of it to the influence of adjacent features of standard segmental phonology on morphemes expressing case assignment. Indeed, other languages lead linguists to expect that allomorphy at a stem-suffix border can depend on any feature of a final vowel: ±Low, ±High, ±Round, ±Back, ±Consonantal or ±Syllabic. Empirically, it turns out that no two Latin stem-final vowels induce identical allomorphy in case/number suffixes, nor the same allomorphy as final consonants. Moreover, some (not much) phonologically conditioned allomorphy is phonetically opaque. 
These two factors have led traditional scholarship to conclude that each stem-final segment should define a separate classification of noun suffixation or “declension”. As there are basically six types of final segment (a, o, u, i, e and consonants), each then gives rise to a different declension (stems with final i are often put in some other group or considered irregular), thus creating five (or six) declensions. Tradition then goes on to analyse stem-final vowels not as part of stems but as some kind of separate morphemes called “thematic vowels” (with no role in either syntax or phonology). 
This essay argues rather that an unflinching modern and formal approach to inflectional allomorphy, exactly analogous to using phonology to reduce regular English plurals to a single lexical form, succeeds in sweeping away the sandcastle of Latin declensions and better captures the actual descriptive generalizations that account for Latin case inflection.

"Gender in Scandinavian. On the gender systems in Mainland Scandinavian, with focus on Swedish",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001966/current.pdf?_s=vybJ0iaLYjyKJKDb,"['Josefsson, Gunlög']","Basing my conclusions on Mainland Scandinavian, primarily Swedish, I argue that a strict division has to be made between three concepts or dimensions of gender: formal gender, semantic gender and lexical gender. Lexical gender is a salient meaning component of a noun; this dimension of gender is syntactically inert. Semantic gender is a category of thought, conveyed by pronominal resources. Semantic genders are for instance categories such as MALE – FEMALE, COUNTABLE – NON-COUNTABLE, and ANIMATE – NON-ANIMATE. Formal gender is a piece of phonology that is added post-syntactically to a derivation. The three dimensions are clearly separate, but they interact, and the pronominal forms associated with the different dimensions are sometimes identical, which might blur the picture.
The formal gender features have basically the same status as the phonological features of a root. Thus, formal gender does not carry any inherent meaning, but participates in the spell-out of semantic distinctions, for example ANIMATE – INANIMATE. Of particular importance is the idea that the feature NEUTER is used in Mainland Scandinavian to spell out the absence of a number feature, which accounts for neuter agreement on so-called pancake sentences. An effect is that NEUTER in such contexts corresponds to NON-COUNTABILITY.
Drawing on work done in the 80s (Bosch 1983, 1986; Cornish 1983), I argue that it is necessary to distinguish between pronouns that refer to a linguistic entity, for example a DP, and pronouns that refer to a discourse entity. This is, in fact, what lies behind they properties of hybrid nouns (Corbett 1991), which are cases where the two ways of making reference make use of different pronominal forms. For Swedish the pronouns den (it.C) ‘it’ and det (it.N) ‘it’ are carefully discussed. It is shown that these pronouns can be used for reference to noun phrases, where the head nouns are formally COMMON GENDER or NEUTER, as well as to to COUNTABLE or NON-COUNTABLE discourse entities.
The analyses are based on Swedish and Mainland Scandinavian, but an out-look is made to some related languages.",['v1 [December 2013]'],2013

Plural Isogloss and Linguistic Change: a Comparative Study of Romance Nouns,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001514/current.pdf?_s=gvmiNmPFYV1zmSm-,"['Lampitelli, Nicola']","Romance nouns display a well-known case of plural isogloss. This consists of two groups of languages: those pluralizing by suffixating -s (cf. Spanish), and those pluralizing by changing the quality of the final vowel (cf. Italian).
In this paper, I propose an explanation to the morphological isogloss. More precisely, I argue that the cross-linguistic diversity within Romance depends on morpho-phonological parameters on the structure of the noun. These parameters consist of language-particular restrictions on the form of the (nominal) roots and the exponents of gender and number.","['romance languages', 'linguistic change', 'nominal inflection', '(parametric) spell-out', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2013
Quantifying the Diachronic Productivity of Irregular Verbal Patterns in Romance,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001969/current.pdf?_s=Wizx74WItfDtq9vr,"['Tang, Kevin', 'Nevins, Andrew']","In this paper, we address the unproductivity of irregular verbal “L”-patterns in Portuguese, Italian and Spanish diachronically in a corpus linguistic study. Using openly available corpora, we answer two questions systematically: firstly whether the size of an active lexicon of a speaker/community remains constant, and secondly, whether the productivity of the regular verbal forms in the first
conjugation -ar(e) increases over time and is a function of verb vocabulary size. By running random sampling simulations on both large and small corpora from different sources for each language, we found a consistent increase, especially after 1750, in both verb vocabulary size and productivity of the regular verbal form -ar(e). The results suggested that productivity of the
regular verbal form is likely to be caused by the increase in verb vocabulary size, and as more new verbs come into a language, they will most likely fall into the first conjugation. This increase in the ratio of new verbs being assigned to the first conjugation caused the irregular forms in the second
and third conjugations -er(e) and -ir(e) to become less productive over time. Finally, we speculate that the 1750 shift across all corpora is possibly caused by the industrial revolution which started around 1760.","['historical linguistics', 'productivity', 'irregular verbs', 'romance languages', 'morphology']",2013
A Unified Syntax of Negation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001973/current.pdf?_s=f-PR6w3butPvvX22,"['De Clercq, Karen']","This dissertation develops a unified syntax for what is often called sentence negation (SN) and constituent negation (CN). I argue that a negative marker, which is usually considered an indivisible unit, can be decomposed into four subatomic features, which can each take scope in a different position in the clause. Under this approach negation is viewed as a complex predicate negator.
This dissertation consists of four parts. The first part introduces the topic and the empirical domain and provides the necessary theoretical background. In the second part the internal syntax of negation is investigated and the third part focusses on how the link between the internal syntax and the external syntax of negation can be established. The final part provides support for the account and extends the proposal.
The empirical trigger for the decomposition of the negative marker into subatomic features is the observation that there are syncretisms between markers expressing SN and markers expressing CN in some languages. From a nanosyntactic perspective syncretism patterns are meaningful. They point to hidden or underlying structure within a unit that is thought of as indivisible. The research hypothesis in this dissertation is therefore that there meaningful syncretism patterns within the domain of negative markers.
In order to be able to detect syncretisms it is necessary to know which types of negative markers there are. On the basis of four properties of negative markers, namely 1) their scope, 2) their ability to stack on other negative markers, 3) their semantic label and 4) their function, a classification of four types of negative marker is made. I distinguish negative polarity markers (PolNeg), focus markers (FocNeg), degree markers (DegNeg) and quantity markers (QNeg).
By means of this four-way classification I look at nine different languages and I detect syncretism patterns within the domain of negative markers. Starting from this ob- servation, the negative marker which is now considered the set of all negative markers, can be decomposed into its subatomic features: N1, N2, N3, N4. From a nanosyntactic perspective every feature corresponds to a syntactic head. This leads to the hierarchical organization of these four features into a binary negative nanospine. I furthermore argue that this negative nanospine is inserted as a complex constituent in the specifier of an abstract semantically negative head, more precisely SpecNegP.

On the basis of the negative nanospine and reconstruction effects I argue in the next part that NegP is base-generated on a lexical predicate. Negation is thus perceived of as a predicate negator rather than a propositional negator, which can have four negative features in its specifier. These negative markers determine the scope of the abstract negator, but are themselves not semantically negative. They are negative scope markers rather than negators.
Furthermore I explain how the features in the nanospine take scope in the positions in the clause. The four positions in the clause that I distinguish for negative scope are PolP, FocP, DegP and QP. I develop a valuation-driven feature system which allows interactions between the markers in the nanospine and the clausal scope projections. The account provides support for a feature system which allows uninterpretable but valued features to be deleted without checking. Checking or not checking leads to interpretative differences.

In a final part I discuss how intervention effects caused by the modal auxiliary must and quantificational adverbs provide support for the proposal developed in this dissertation. I extend the proposal to French negation and I show how the system can capture diachronic change.","['negation', 'nanosyntax', 'syncretisms', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2013

Splitting Objects: a Nanosyntactic account of direct object marking,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001976/current.pdf?_s=_ioqXBj573KEmry-,"['Rocquet, Amélie']","This dissertation provides a novel perspective on direct object marking. I essentially argue that object agreement markers are the spell-out on verbs of differential object markers base-generated within direct objects.The theory is developed in the Nanosyntactic framework on the basis of Hungarian data. It is then extended to lay the foundations for a nanosyntactic analysis of direct object marking cross-linguistically. 
I start with an introduction to the Nanosyntactic framework. Then, I present the phenomenon of object agreement in Hungarian, in which the definiteness of a direct object is morphologically encoded on the finite verb. I then proceed to a meticulous decomposition of Hungarian pronominal direct objects and object agreement markers. I show that the latter are the spell out of a structural layer base-generated within the former. Subsequently, I extend the analysis to Hungarian full direct object DPs. On the basis of cross-linguistic differential object marking data, I argue that the structure of definite direct objects contains (at least) one more layer than the structure of indefinite direct objects. This additional layer is usually spelled out by a preposition or a morpheme affixed on direct objects. In Hungarian, however, this layer raises to the vicinity of the verb (I argue that this movement is triggered by QR). Hence, contra traditional approaches, definiteness marking of a direct object in Hungarian does not result from a feature valuation mechanism between a verb and its direct object but from the spell-out on the verb of a differential object marker. 
Finally, I suggest to extend this analysis of direct object agreement to other languages such as Ostyak, Swahili and French.",['v1 [December 2013]'],2013

This paper deals with a concrete case, namely the analysis of the present tense agreement paradigm of Standard Dutch. Many possible analyses can and have been proposed to capture two basic facts: (i) the distribution of three distinct affixes accross the paradigm space and (ii) the fact that in 2sg contexts the -t is dropped in inversion orders.

A look at the straight and inversion order paradigms of agreement inflection in 267 varieties of Dutch reveals the existence of four exceptionless generalizations on paradigm structure. Under the assumption that these generalizations act as restrictions on the variation space, probably brought in through the process of language acquisition, the number of possible analyses for a single synchronic paradigm, including the standard Dutch one, is drastically reduced. We provide the first analysis of the Standard Dutch agreement paradigm that is compatible with these restrictions. In addition, we claim that two different types of inversion morphology can be theoretically as well as empirically distinguished.

The Spatiotemporal Dimensions of Person - A Morphosyntactic Account of Indexical Pronouns,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001971/current.pdf?_s=JUMSdOoPu0gg_xgh,"['Gruber, Bettina']","This dissertation is concerned with the deictic and grammatical category person and its associated linguistic expressions: indexical, i.e. first and second person, pronouns. Under the hypothesis that sentence meaning is computed from how words and their associated lexical information combine with each other, indexical pronouns present an interesting challenge: their actual referent can only be determined once interpreted with respect to the utterance context they are being used in. Formulated within the Chomskyan framework of generative syntax, this thesis develops a novel approach to the relationship between the morphosyntactic content, the interpretational ranges, and the associated crosslinguistic variation of these pronouns. Primarily based on data from Dutch, English, German (Indoeuropean), and Blackfoot (Algonquian), the main conclusion of this thesis is that person is derivative of spatiotemporal information: Firstly, temporal information plays a crucial role in its interpretation. Secondly, spatial information contributes the necessary contextual anchoring. Empirically, this dissertation draws on data from the domains of genericity, possession, tense, and modality. On the basis of this evidence it is shown that the spatiotemporal information underlying indexical pronouns is also encoded morphosyntactically. From a broader perspective, this dissertation addresses questions concerning the relation between context and syntax, morphology and syntax, as well as syntax and semantics.","['indexicality', 'person', 'anchoring', 'coincidence', 'genericity', 'possession', 'english', 'german', 'dutch', 'blackfoot', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2013

null subject languages through what I call head ellipsis, a morphological operation subjected
to the same locality conditions that other post-syntactic operations. Head ellipsis dictates
when and how a particular syntactic object should be pronounced. Thus, Northern Italian
dialects are seen as null subject languages with some subjects phonetically realized by the
same reasons that apply in other cases of multiple copy realization. In turn, Brazilian
Portuguese is a non-null subject language with some null subjects. Crucially, these subjects
are not the result of morphological head ellipsis, but of another syntactic mechanism of
licensing.",['v2 [November 2013]v1 [January 2012]'],2013
On the identity of Roots,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001527/current.pdf?_s=qX8NuK8raGnk-Ag5,"['Harley, Heidi']","In Distributed Morphology, the term 'root' names a particular theoretical construct which plays an important role in the framework. Here, empirical evidence is brought to bear which illuminates the nature of roots in this model. It is argued that neither phonological properties nor semantic properties are sufficient to individuate root nodes in the syntax. In consequence, a purely formal notion of root identity is needed for use in syntactic computation, to which phonological and/or semantic properties can be attached at the relevant point, both potentially contingent upon particular morphosyntactic contexts.  The conclusion is that syntactic roots are individuated as pure units of structural computation, lacking (in the syntax) both semantic content and phonological features. Following (Pfau 2000; Pfau 2009) and (Acquaviva 2008), an index notation is adopted, according to which individual syntactic roots are referred to simply by a numerical address. The idea is that the address serves as the linkage between a set of instructions for phonological realization in context and a set of instructions for semantic interpretation in context.  Having established this framework, the paper asks how do root nodes behave in the syntactic component, and what kinds of conditions are imposed on their semantic and/or phonological interpretation at the interfaces? In the second half of this paper, arguments are given that roots can and do take complements and project, and again, the empirical basis for the argument draws on  both semantic and morphophonological data, as well as syntactic evidence. It is clear that different morphosyntactic environments can trigger special meanings and pronunciations of roots. Some recent proposals (Marantz 2001; Marantz 2008; Arad 2003; Arad 2005) argue for a very stringent locality condition on root interpretations. With  (Borer 2009), I argue that the constraints cannot be quite so restrictive, and argue for a return to the view of the relevant locality domain originally advanced in (Marantz 1995b; Marantz 1997), according to which the projection which hosts the external argument marks the domain edge.","['roots', 'idioms', 'suppletion', 'allomorphy', 'locality', 'selection', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2013

I analyze the directionals as fully fledged PathPs whose internal syntax is based on Ritter and Wiltschko’s (2009) implementation of the coincidence theme.

These base structures and their interaction with other components of the predicative and attributive domains explain the documented properties of attributive and predicative poss possessives, including, crucially, the sometimes divergent behaviors of these two possessive constructions.","['asl', 'possessives', 'morpho-syntax', 'semantics', 'locatives', 'relative clauses', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2013

It does not contain categorial heads (i.e. little heads) or functional projections. As such, the discussion supports the hypothesis that the most minimal lexical projection is a root (Halle and Marantz 1993, Borer 2005). Given that the non-heads of these compounds consist of nothing but bare roots, they are an important testing ground to study the behavior of lexical projections in the absence of functional projections. As a first illustration of this methodological advantage, I present primary compounds which contain more than two roots and I show that they may contain idiomatic clusters which do not correspond to constituents.

There are two problematic aspects about the morphological passive: (1) in all the languages mentioned except Swedish, it is restricted to certain tenses and/or conjugation classes, and (2) from a theoretical perspective, it constitutes what looks like a mirror violation: the passive voice-marker surfaces outside of the tense-marker, even though it arguably originates between tense and the lexical verb. I argue that previous analyses of the passive -s(t) as either a clitic realizing the external argument (Julien 2007), or as a mood marker (Heltoft and Jakobsen 1996) can neither explain the tense/declension class restrictions, nor the semantics of the  -s(t)-passive. I argue instead that morphological passives in Danish, Bokmål and Nynorsk never contain a tense projection, and they are licensed in finite contexts when the finite form is form-identical with a non-finite form, that ``fools'' the syntax in the C-phase of the clause (where at least some of the underlying syntactic features of the lexical items are no longer active). In Swedish on the other hand, the tensed forms are licensed through Tense-copying, which is known to exist in Swedish to a much higher degree than in the other Scandinavian languages (Wiklund 2007).

Embick (2012) provides two key arguments: double marking and the containment prediction. In this paper we respond to both criticisms of INT. We show that double marking is an artifact of the aggressive decomposition mandated by terminal-only insertion, and that containment is a problem for terminal-only insertion just as it is for non-terminal insertion. We
then propose an alternative to both models which employs insertion that realizes many contiguous members of the string of features present after linearization. We argue that this proposal appears to better account for the data under discussion.","['distributed morphology', 'vocabulary insertion', 'suppletion', 'readjustment', 'double marking', 'containment', 'blocking', 'decomposition', 'productivity', 'opacity', 'insertion into non-terminals', 'terminal-only insertion', 'borrowed morphology', 'morphology']",2013

Other differences, it is argued, can be attributed to independently attested differences between the two languages (e.g. multiple wh-movement in Russian, availability of null comitatives in EP).","['control', 'partial control', 'defective intervention', 'agree', 'inflected infinitives', 'portuguese', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2013

Cross-linguistic evidence for the subject processing advantage (SPA) has come mostly from accusative languages where grammatical function and case correspond, preventing researchers from investigating whether case or grammatical function underlies the SPA. Ergative languages allow for the separation of case and function, since more than one case is associated with the subject position. Prior results on the processing of ergative languages suggest that function and case are equally important in RC processing and differential effects are also visible. The ergative cues the projection the absolutive object, which gives preference to the absolutive, but the ergative is also preferred as subject. This paper tests these findings by examining the processing of RCs in Ch’ol and Q’anjob’al, two head- initial ergative languages that mark ergativity via agreement. The results again support the SPA but do not show any cueing by the ergative agreement marker. We conclude that case is superior to agreement in tracking grammatical function, and in the absence of case cues, structural preferences become more pronounced. Therefore the SPA is evident in both ergative and accusative languages.","['ergativity', 'mayan', 'processing', 'relative clauses', 'subjects', 'subject preference', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2013

I argue that the German bare vs. inflected universal quantifier dichotomy constitutes a solid basis for the proposal of two diverging quantifier phrases (QP). Additionally, evidence is put forth for the existence of two discrete possessive heads (Poss0). The main difference between these two instances will be found in their value of grammatical definiteness due to their varying positions. With these axioms combined, we arrive at a symmetrical bisection of [±definite] QP and PossP encircling the nominal core categories D and N, respectively. I also make use of this phrasal configuration to develop an algorithm for the evaluation of morphological form on strong quantifiers, which is arguably also applicable in further instances of morphological evaluation, namely the division of strong/weak adjective inflection in exceptional case-marking configurations. In addition, the analysis proposed thereby allows pinning down the locus of application of said algorithm at an early stage in the phonological component: the subcomponent Morphology (Chomsky 1995).","['definiteness', 'quantification', 'optionality', 'german', 'minimalist program', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2013

Classifications of this kind play no role in the syntactic/semantic computation, but are crucial in triggering the application of the appropriate morphophonological rule to yield the correct surface form in such cases. The existence of such morphophonological classifications, irrelevant to syntax, is thus an argument against the lexeme, as such, and in favor of the DM-style separation of the two lists: List 1, input to the syntax (the source of the Numeration in Minimalist syntactic theories), and List 2, Vocabulary Items which simply realize the output of the syntax. Further, the Hiaki case provides a clear argument for Vocabulary Insertion applying to Root elements (l-morphemes, in Harley & Noyer 2000's terminology), as well as to f-morphemes. In addition, the notion of a phasal cycle within the word proves useful in permitting a simple statement of the relevant conditioning context for the application of morphophonological rules.","['distributed morphology', 'roots', 'morphological classes', 'root suppletion', 'phases within words', 'readjustment rules', 'morphology']",2013

Sundanese presents the same basic structural options as the other three languages. Examining the grammatical characteristics of the long distance questions, we conclude that, as in Madurese, there is no evidence for interclausal A¢-movement in Sundanese and that the apparent cases of long-distance movement are best analyzed as instances of A-movement. These questions thus appear to share some characteristics of nominal wh-questions in other western Austronesian languages, such as Malagasy (Keenan 2008) and Tagalog (Gerassimova & Sells 2008).","['sundanese', 'wh-question', ""a'-movement"", 'a-movement', 'indonesian', 'malay', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2013
On Vocabulary Insertion,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001837/current.pdf?_s=9UYaWkSfUl4rKNIM,"['De Belder, Marijke', 'Van Craenenbroeck, Jeroen']","The term Vocabulary Insertion (henceforth VocIns) refers to the mechanism through which vocabulary items such as 'the' or 'book' are inserted into the syntactic derivation. In this paper we re-examine VocIns from the point of view of DM and argue that it is in need of revision.
The DM system of VocIns is set up such that lexical vocabulary items (LVIs) are inserted into root terminal nodes (RTNs) and functional vocabulary items (FVIs) are inserted into functional terminal nodes (FTNs). Generally speaking, though, if there are two types of terminal nodes and two types of vocabulary items and if VocIns is characterized as the pairing of a terminal node with a vocabulary item, there should in principle be four types of pairings. They are listed in (1).
(1)	a. FVIs in FTNs, b. LVIs in RTNs, c. FVIs in RTNs, d. LVIs in FTNs
The options in (1)a and (1)b are the ones that are allowed by the analysis just outlined, while (1)c-d are ruled out. However, whether or not these final two patterns occur is ultimately an empirical question, one which is rarely taken up in the DM-literature on VocIns, if at all. The present paper aims to fill this void. We examine cases where FVIs show up in RTNs as well as instances of LVIs occurring in FTNs. We argue that while the former pattern is real (and thus constitutes evidence against the standard DM-approach to VocIns), the latter is only apparent. We present a modified theory of VocIns from which this asymmetric picture follows.",['924 times'],2013

Instead, we argue that the PrePs are really morphological prefixes that express the oblique case assigned to NP by a postposition (null or overt).  What is somewhat unusual about Amharic, then, is where this prefix shows up in complex nominals. We argue that the case feature is not manifested on the first word of the NP, or the last word, or the noun head, but rather on the structurally highest element of the nominal, defined recursively.  This explains the position of the PreP in nominals that have one or more adjectival modifiers, demonstratives, possessor expressions, and relative clauses, as well as its special location in verbal noun constructions.  We briefly contrast our analysis with one that makes use only of leftward

look-ahead problem. We argue that the case split is not driven by GFs;

possessor. Importantly, we argue that there is no evidence for a possessor
raising analysis in Udmurt. We present an analysis according to
which the possessor always bears genitive but may be assigned another
structural case by an external head. Due to a morphological constraint,
stacked case features fuse into a single feature set in the postsyntactic
morphological component. If accusative and genitive stack on the possessor,
only the default semantic case marker, i.e., the ablative marker,
can realize the resulting feature set. In any other context the genitive
marker is chosen. We thus claim that there is no abstract ablative on the
possessor; instead, the morphological ablative marker realizes a combination
of two abstract structural cases.","['possession', 'abstract vs. morphological case', 'case stacking', 'fusion', 'possessor raising', 'uralic languages', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2013

Thus, we contend that these languages do not support the existence of licensors.  Instead, we propose an account within the framework of Distributed Morphology, arguing that the patterns of gender and definiteness marking seen in Danish and Icelandic are the result of competition for insertion between well-motivated vocabulary items.

Rather than being prespecified in Universal Grammar, it is proposed that the parameter hierarchy in question is structured by the pressure for convergence: ordering the relevant parameters in any other way makes possible non-convergent derivations.

Notably, the modular architecture of grammar predicts the possible modes of implementation of phonological change, including neogrammarian regularity, and lays down the track for the life cycle of sound patterns. In turn, an understanding of this life cycle relieves grammatical theory of the need to explain a wide range of synchronic phenomena. In the course of the life cycle, for example, it is normal for innovative phonological rules not to replace the phonetic processes from which they emerge, but to coexist with them. This type of rule scattering can create the appearance of morphologically sensitive phonetics without actually violating modularity. Similarly, the life cycle creates a tendency for older phonological processes to apply at higher levels in the grammar than younger ones. For this reason, younger generalized versions of existing phonological processes tend to apply in wider morphosyntatic domains, as do relatively new and aggressive processes of reduction in diachronic lenition trajectories.","['amphichronic', 'modular', 'stratal', 'neogrammarian', 'categorical', 'gradient', 'life cycle', 'phonologization', 'stabilization', 'domain narrowing', 'morphology-free phonetics', 'rule scattering', 'rule generalization', 'lenition', 'phonology']",2013

(i) is a purely morphological phenomenon arising as a consequence of the logically possible specifications of local person exponents. Person portmanteaux are analyzed as inclusive exponents in a derived inclusive context. Since such a context can only emerge in local scenarios, (iii) is derived as well. Local scenarios are thus far more systematic than has previously been thought. In general, the paper contributes to the discussion on how morphological theories that rely on discrete slots (DM, PFM) can handle portmanteau morphemes with standard vocabulary insertion and without additional mechanisms like fusion, head movement or spell-out of non-terminals.

Neither of them analyses the grammaticalization of KPs (case-markers) and so this is the theme of this paper. The grammaticalization of two very important Latin/Romance KPs (de marking genitive, ad marking dative) indeed conforms to both Robert & Roussou’s and Ledgeway’s hypotheses, since they originate from Latin PPs (de denoting separation, ad denoting direction), and within X’-theory complements (e.g. KPs) are ‘simpler’ than adjuncts (e.g. PPs) in that the former require fewer feature place-holders than the latter (Robert & Roussou (2003:106)), and so by Roberts & Roussou’s (2003:200-201) ‘structural simplification’ (reduction of ‘feature syncretisms’) PPs are grammaticalized as KPs. Robert & Roussou’s ‘structural simplification’ assumes configurationality and can only occur in configurational syntax, and so configurationality is a prerequisite for grammaticalization in Minimalism, which conforms to Ledgeway’s argument (2011a:405-434)) that the key syntactic change from Latin to Romance is the rise of configurationality, which gives rise to functional categories in Romance (Ledgeway (2011a:409)). Finally, as configurationality is a controversial notion, alternative scenarios are considered in the appendix where configurationality no longer has explanatory value, and ‘re-analysis’ is argued to be the key to understanding grammaticalization, since it is in itself sufficient to explain grammaticalization, with or without configurationality.  

Simpson and Wu (2002) and Wu’s (2004) ‘lateral grammaticalization’ is a Minimalist analysis of Chinese de, which has been re-analysed from a determiner (D) to a verbal suffix (T). Roberts and Roussou (2003) and van Gelderen (2011) deal with grammaticalization within Minimalism, though neither take ‘lateral grammaticalization’ into account (Vincent and Borjars (2010:293)). A comparison between these accounts reveals that Roberts and Roussou’s (2003) and van Gelderen’s (2011) ‘feature economy’ also accounts for the cross-linguistic distribution of ‘lateral grammaticalization’, which is the main theoretical thrust of their accounts (Roberts and Roussou (2003:2-7), van Gelderen (2011:4-17)). However, the lack of ‘upward feature analysis’ (Roberts and Roussou (2003:200)) in ‘lateral grammaticalization’ sets it formally apart from grammaticalization, and this ties in empirically with the lack of ‘phonological weakening’, ‘univerbation’ and ‘semantic bleaching’ in ‘lateral grammaticalization’ when these are the diagnostic traits of grammaticalization (Campbell (2001), Roberts and Roussou (2003:224-232)).

On Suffixhood and Verbalness: A Mirror Theoretic Approach,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001640/current.pdf?_s=_uqSGYhmaSUHJZhM,"['Bayirli, Isa']","In this thesis, I argue that suffixal and verbal status of a grammatical object can be predicted from its syntactic position within the framework of the Mirror Theoretic syntax of Brody (2003). 

I first show that in Turkish there is a constraint that dictates that the 
morpheme syntactically right above a verbal item be suffixed to this verbal item, which I dub V-X. I argue that X-bar Theory is not well-suited to capture this observation of suffixhood as a syntax-related phenomenon. I show that, in an antilexicalist implementation, the Mirror Theory of Brody (2003) can capture V-X as a reflex of syntax, relating it to the inability of verbal items to show phrasal behavior. I argue that this follows from the fact that verbal items can only occupy a complement position (one of the two logically possible positions) in Mirror Theoretic syntax. I present evidence from Basque, Japanese, Hindi and English to show that V-X is a valid constraint in these languages and that this is correlated with the fact that verbal items cannot show phrasal behavior in these languages.  

I, then, argue that, in direct opposition to verbal items, two non-verbal items 
(nouns and non-verbal participles) always show phrasal behavior in Turkish. I 
present evidence from earlier works, indicating that the inflection on non-verbal items is always phrasal (and not suffixal) and that head-movement analysis of noun incorporation in line with Baker (1988) is not the right analysis for Turkish. With this, I argue that non-verbal items can only occupy the other position (i.e. the specifier position) in Mirror Theoretic syntax. I present further evidence from Basque, Japanese, Hindi and English, indicating that the claim that the non-verbal elements are always phrasal objects has cross-linguistic validity. I show that, with a few exceptions, in these languages, too, nominal inflection is phrasal inflection and that head-movement of bare objects is not the right analysis in the context of noun incorporation.  

Lastly, I outline a theory of lexical features where the [+/- verbal] and [+/- 
suffix] features are replaced by features that indicate what syntactic position an object may occupy in Mirror Theoretic syntax.","['mirror theory', 'suffixhood', 'verbalness', 'syntax-morphology interface', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2013

Therefore current assumptions cannot prove satisfactorily what should be regarded as systematic in morphology. We propose that accidental homophony should be assumed to be a random event in the statistical sense with a constant probability across languages and across paradigms. This approach allows us to assign a likelihood to any actual typological distribution of syncretism given a morphological analysis. And by computing such likelihoods for a range of analyses, we can then apply maximum likelihood analysis to determine the best analyses. Hence, the statistical foundation allows us to empirically test morphological analyses that include accidental syncretism. In this paper, we primarily introduce the conceptual and mathematical foundations of a statistical modeling technique, Syncretism Distribution Modeling, and show how it overcomes the problem of accidental homophony. In addition, we apply the technique to show that person paradigms must involve both accidental homophony and systematic syncretism.","['linguistics', 'features', 'paradigms', 'universals', 'typology', 'morphology']",2013

Ratings improve as distance between stresses increases, and this effect is gradient rather than categorical. We also identify new generalizations about secondary stress that relates to the properties of the left-hand stem. First, we identify a faithfulness effect: stress realization is optional on lexically stressed stems, but stress movement is strongly penalized. Second, we identify a sonority sequencing effect: secondary stress is not tolerated well on linker vowels in compounds, but acceptability improves significantly when the linker is the only vowel in a stem with a falling sonority cluster.

Primary vs. Secondary Vocabulary,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003592/current.pdf?_s=r3oNYFdiWAu_ktiB,"['Emonds, Joseph']","English vocabulary is divided: a Germanic core inherited from Germanic sources and a second vocabulary borrowed from the Romance family and Classical Greek. Several synchronic criteria divide the two vocabularies. 
The primary vocabulary still conforms to the general Proto-Germanic rule; stress can only fall on a morpheme’s first syllable. In contrast, its secondary vocabulary stress patterns follow Chomsky and Halle’s (1968) “Main stress rule”, often referred to as the “Romance stress rule.” There are several correlations between this stress-based division and morpho-syntactic properties; secondary vocabulary always exhibits regular productive inflection and analytic grading of adjectives.
This study focuses especially on syntactic differences: only primary vocabulary verbs freely combine with post-verbal particles of direction, and allow double objects with no preposition. These general properties seem hard to express in lexical terms. Nonetheless, a device proposed here seems to capture both these English-particular characteristics: Secondary vocabulary verbs do not lexically select complements whose heads have the feature +DIRECTION. Though at first glance this condition seems too strong, the essay argues that this restriction can stand when indirect objects are structurally properly analyzed.

Definite Spans and Blocking in Classifier Languages,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001681/current.pdf?_s=illxgwD1U5csYbsS,"['Jenks, Peter']","This paper presents a new DP analysis of classifier languages. The motivation for this analysis comes from the classifier-modifier construction (CMC) in Thai, in which a predicative modifier can license a bare classifier, resulting in a definite singular interpretation. I argue that the definite readings are due to a null choice-functional determiner (Reinhart 1997, Winter 1997), which takes the modifier as its complement (Kayne 1994). I propose that the modifier licenses the bare classifier, otherwise prohibited, because head raising relative clause structures bleed the environment for a D-Clf-N span to be realized as a bare noun (Brody 2000, Svenonius 2012, a.o.). I argue that this coalescence-based account of definite noun phrases, specifically definite bare nouns, is an improvement on accounts based on head movement (Cheng and Sybesma 1999) or semantic type-shifting (Chierchia 1998). This analysis correctly derives the generalization that languages allowing definite bare classifiers mostly prohibit definite bare nouns, captures Chierchia’s nominal typology without resorting to semantic variation, and provides a novel explanation for the apparent optionality of functional morphology in analytic languages.

In this article, we demonstrate that all the empirical arguments against this hypothesis are seriously flawed and that it therefore must be rehabilitated in its strongest form. Moreover, we argue that the correlation between syntax and morphology is not direct (morphology does not drive syntax) but results from acquisition: only if language learners are confronted with particular morphological contrasts do they postulate the presence of corresponding formal features that in turn drive syntactic operations. More concretely, we demonstrate that only if language learners can infer that argumenthood is grammaticalized in their target language are they able to postulate a particular functional projection in the extended vP to which the finite verb must move.

This synchronic difference in categorization can be related to different historical developments, as proposed by Lötscher (1993): both elements go back to the preposition gen ‘towards’ and developed into a functional head with purpose/goal semantics that combines with a non-finite verbal projection. We will show that while gi in Bodensee-Alemannic still heads this functional projection, go in Swiss German has been reanalyzed as a verbal element and is now integrated into the Verb Raising and Verb Projection Raising system.","['motion verbs', 'swiss german', 'alemannic', 'verb cluster', 'grammaticalization', 'verb doubling', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012
Contextual neutralization and the Elsewhere Principle,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001690/current.pdf?_s=GaHHXMELSCBBHjwH,"['Arregi, Karlos', 'Nevins, Andrew']","We propose a revision to the Elsewhere Principle, in which contextual specification within the environment of a vocabulary entry trumps the inherent morphosyntactic specification borne by the vocabulary entry itself in cases of competition. Application of this principle accounts for contextual neutralization, a phenomenon that we exemplify with two case studies. One is Basque proclitic realization, in which the case of a pronominal clitic is neutralized according to its linearized position. The second is the realization of Bulgarian definite articles, which neutralize gender distinctions depending on the phonology of the host noun to their left. In understanding this latter pattern, we offer an analysis of the facts presented in Harizanov & Gribanova 2011, in which these definite articles appear to depend on phonology alone when found in conjunction structures with coordinated adjectives. We argue that the latter phenomenon reflects a modularization of Agree into two-steps: a syntactic Agree-Link, and a postsyntactic Agree-Copy, following much recent work (e.g. Bhatt & Walkow, to appear). Lowering of the postposed determiner is interleaved between these two operations, thereby feeding a stage of Agree-Copy in which the closest c-commanding goal is chosen as a value-source. The proposed revisions to the theory of Distributed Morphology within the paper open new roads of inquiry for understanding phenomena often posed as a challenge to phonology-free syntax, as recently discussed in Svenonius (2012).","['distributed morphology', 'elsewhere principle', 'basque clitics', 'bulgarian definite articles', 'agreement', 'two-step agree', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012
Preposition stranding in Welsh,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001868/current.pdf?_s=CfMBFbWULA_zGh_3,"['Hirata, Ryuichiro']","This dissertation investigates preposition stranding observed in Colloquial Welsh using a generative grammar approach.
Welsh traditionally disallows P-stranding. In Literary Welsh, prepositional relatives require a resumptive pronoun which is licensed by the rich agreement of P, and wh-questions require pied-piping of the entire PP. However, the use of uninflected stranded preposition can be found colloquially, both in relatives and wh-questions.
This dissertation proposes an account of the different syntactic behaviour between the two varieties, based on the notion of PF feature checking proposed by Ackema and Neeleman (2004). I claim that if PF checking takes place between a P head and its DP complement, the DP will be unable to move out of the complement position. This means that P-stranding is impossible. On the other hand, if PF checking does not hold between P and its complement, P-stranding is possible.","['preposition stranding', 'welsh', 'resumption', 'pf feature checking', 'contact-induced change', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

Serial Verb Nominalization in Akan [PhD Thesis],https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002228/current.pdf?_s=4yRbH-f89Mgrlw8i,"['Kambon, Obadele']","This thesis focuses on nominalization of serial verb constructions (SVCs) in the Akan language. The study develops a relevant typology of serial verb nominalization on the basis of semantic integration and lexicalization using a prototype theory (PT) framework. The three degrees of semantic integration for serial verbs in Akan are Full Lexicalized-Integrated Serial Verb Constructions (FL-ISVCs), Partial Lexicalized-Integrated Serial Verb Constructions (PL-ISVCs) and Clause Chaining Serial Constructions (CCSCs). Each type of SVC is analyzed on the basis of how it is nominalized, the degree to which nominalization occurs and whether nominalization can occur at all. Various corpuses were consulted in three major literary dialects of Akan: Asante Twi, Fante and Akuapem Twi. Further, native speakers of each of these dialects were consulted to ascertain the goodness of various attested serial verb nominals (SVNs) in Akan.
Because Full Lexicalized-Integrated Serial Verb Constructions behave as lexicalized idioms, four criteria of idiomaticity are applied to them including collocability, familiarity, flexibility and compositionality (Barkema 1996). The results from the study show that over 98% of all FL-ISVCs identified have nominal counterparts while less than 3% of all PL-ISVCs identified have nominal counterparts. CCSCs seem to nominalize haphazardly as frozen sentences, proverbs, idioms and figures of speech which primarily function as denotata and designata. While there was some degree of interdialectal variability with regard to individual SVNs, the pattern of nominalization behavior on the basis of degrees of semantic integration and lexicalization remained consistent across dialects.","['akan', 'twi', 'asante', 'ashanti', 'akuapem', 'akwapim', 'fante', 'fanti', 'mfantse', 'serial verb construction', 'nominalization', 'lexicalization', 'grammaticalization', 'idiomaticity', 'idiom', 'semantic integration', 'iconicity', 'prototype theory', 'collocation', 'snowball sampling', 'questionnaire', 'survey', 'focus group', 'collocability', 'familiarity', 'flexibility', 'compositionality', 'denotata', 'designata', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

A comparison between these accounts reveals that Roberts and Roussou’s (2003) and van Gelderen’s (2011) ‘feature economy’ also accounts for the cross-linguistic distribution of ‘lateral grammaticalization’, which is the main theoretical thrust of their accounts (Roberts and Roussou (2003:2-7), van Gelderen (2011:4-17)). However, the lack of ‘upward feature analysis’ (Roberts and Roussou (2003:200)) in ‘lateral grammaticalization’ sets it formally apart from grammaticalization, and this ties in empirically with the lack of ‘phonological weakening’, ‘univerbation’ and ‘semantic bleaching’ in ‘lateral grammaticalization’ when these are the diagnostic traits of grammaticalization (Campbell (2001), Roberts and Roussou (2003:224-232)).

Context and Co(reference) in the syntax and its interfaces,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001743/current.pdf?_s=CtGMbct4_FbIeLfj,"['Sundaresan, Sandhya']","It is well known that referentially defective nominals fall into two broad
categories: pro-forms whose reference seems structurally constrained (local anaphors, OC PRO) and those which are discourse-pragmatically conditioned (logophors, deictic pronouns, indexicals). Nevertheless, a strict binary distinction cannot be maintained because most actually straddle the syntax-discourse divide: e.g. deictic pronouns can be variable-bound, indexicals may be “shifted” under certain intensional operators, and logophors and long-distance anaphors often look and behave alike.

The central thesis of this dissertation is that a proper subset of pro-
forms can receive a unified analysis under an enriched grammatical model that posits the syntactic representation of mental and/or spatio-temporal perspective. To this end, I present novel evidence from verbal agreement
triggered under anaphora to show that even so-called “logophoric” reference involves an indelible syntactic core. I propose that perspective is featurally represented on a silent pronominal operator in the specifier of a Perspectival  phrase (PerspP) at the phasal-edge of certain CPs, PPs, DPs, and AspPs and may be exploited to yield a unified account of anaphora and agreement patterns triggered under it. Anaphora involves two distinct dependencies: an Agree relationship between the anaphor and the operator in the [Spec, PerspP] of its minimal phase, which is the equivalent of syntactic binding, and a conceptual relationship between the antecedent and this operator, which is the equivalent of non-obligatory control. Thus, all binding is local and syntactic; all antecedence is non-local and (primarily) non-syntactic. I also illustrate that
perspective must be kept conceptually and structurally distinct from the Kaplanian utterance context and the intensional “context” responsible for indexical shift.

Evidence from its distribution and morphological form indicate that it is a doubled clitic, but it also displays a handful of properties characteristic of agreement.  Building on some of the most recent clitic doubling research, I develop an Agree-based clitic doubling analysis of the object marker that accounts for both its doubled clitic-like and agreement-like properties.  Overall, the paper is a case study in how to distinguish clitic doubling and agreement in a particular language, and an investigation of how to capture the relationship between these two deeply similar phenomena in linguistic theory.",['v1 [September 2011]'],2012

new gender distinction in the plural constituted the trigger for numeralization
of the nominal numerals which shifted from NP to NumP and as lexicalizations
of NumP they began spelling out the gender information it introduced. As a result
of this process, numerals have lost their own nominal properties (-features:

In this study, we investigate whole word frequency effects in English regularly inflected words. We model a very large database of visual lexical decision latencies at the trial level with mixed effects regression, using residualization to control for confounding predictors of reaction time. We conclude that whole word frequency effects we observe do not argue in favor of whole word storage; in fact, they are inconsistent with the predictions of dual-route processing models.","['morphological processing', 'visual word recognition', 'frequency effects', 'whole word storage', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2012

external positions to which specific themes must raise--a relatively high position for pronoun

themes. The distribution of syntactic positions available for the theme argument is claimed to

The first case study focuses on the structure of attributive and predicative POSS possessives. Based on language-internal diagnostics, this study shows that the possessive marker, POSS, functions as a verbal predicate of possession, not as a DP-internal marker of the possessive relation. The structure and interpretation of predicative POSS possessives are reduced to the interaction of the verbal POSS structure with two functional components of the predicative domain: (i) locative structure and (ii) licensing positions of definite objects. Attributive POSS possessives are derived as prenominal reduced relative clause modifiers formed from this underlying predicative structure.

The second case study presented here addresses the structural uniformity and semantic ambiguity of two classes of deverbal nominals formed via reduplication in ASL: concrete object-denoting nominals and result-denoting nominals. Based on a morpho-semantic decomposition of verbal structure that is transparent in the surface form of verbal predicates in ASL, it is shown that nominalization via reduplication targets the lowest constituent of the verbal structure (VP-Res). Nominalization of VP-Res yields the class of result-denoting nominals, while concrete object-denoting nominals are derived as relative clause structures headed by a nominal argument that is introduced by the classifier structure present in the relevant verbal forms.","['possession', 'nominalization', 'american sign language', 'relative clauses', 'verb structure', 'reduplication', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

There are two main differences: (i) different types of adjectival inflections (weak vs. strong) indicate nominal structures involving different degrees of embedding of adjectives in simple vs. complex DPs; (ii) ein supports overt semantic operators (e.g., k = NEG as in kein ‘no’) and “flags” the presence of covert semantic operators (e.g., TYPE).

We argue that all affixal verb combinations in this language involve VP complementation in support of Wurmbrand’s (2007) analysis of complex predicates and that they are syntactically transparent in the sense of Wurmbrand (2001). That is, they invariably take vP phases (in the sense of Legate 2003) as their complements, which explains both the syntactic and morphological characteristics of the complement clause. These V-V combinations are contrasted with opacity-inducing (CP embedding) complement clauses available in this language, incidentally involving the heavy version of some verbs appearing in the V-V constructions. Finally, we offer evidence that all suffixes participating in complex predicates in Hiaki are affixal light verbs, as defined in Butt (1993), and not auxiliaries or serial verbs, shedding more light on the distinction among these classes.","['complex predicates', 'verb incorporation', 'light verbs', 'uto-aztecan', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

Our account is based on the following core assumptions. (i) In languages with person agreement, the person specification of the verb is identical to that of the subject, even where this is not reflected by surface forms. (ii) First, second and third person are composed of two features, one shared by first and second person, the other shared by second and third person (see Kerstens 1993, Bennis and MacLean 2007, and Aalberse and Don 2010). (iii) Phi-features are organized in a feature geometry (see Gazdar and Pullum 1982 and Harley and Ritter 2002). (iv) Rules that operate on features (rules of impoverishment and spell-out rules) are sensitive to this geometry. We demonstrate that all four assumptions are motivated independently of the typological generalizations concerning the cross-linguistic frequency of patterns of syncretism. We test our proposal through a case study of Dutch agreement. In different circumstances, this language displays syncretism of second and third person, of first and second person, and even of first and third person, and it therefore provides a challenge for any theory aiming to explain person syncretism.","['syncretism', 'agreement', 'person features', 'feature geometry', 'impoverishment', 'dutch', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

Morphosyntactic analyses that address both aspects of gender are relatively rare, and they often play down or eliminate the role of natural gender in the morphosyntax.  In this paper, I will argue for a new analysis of the relationship between grammatical gender and natural gender, using evidence from the language Amharic (Ethiosemitic). I show how conventional analyses of gender struggle with Amharic, and develop an alternative analysis that crucially relies on natural gender and grammatical gender both being features on n (cf. Lecarme, 2002, Ferrari, 2005, inter alia; I assume lexical categories are decomposed into a category-defining head and a category-neutral root). Further evidence for the analysis is provided by the unusual interaction of gender and number in Amharic, as well as the morphosyntax of Amharic nominalizations.

We propose that this asymmetry follows from the hybrid syntactic structures of the kena-passive construction. Specifically, we argue that the verb kena allows not only the standard passive structure of the type discussed by Bao and Wee but also the active structure which embeds a sentential complement comprising of pro and the active verb. This analysis is supported by a variety of arguments regarding the kena-active complement structure independently available in Singapore English (Yap and Lim 2011) as well as the Chinese (Feng 1995; Huang 1999) and Baba Malay (Ansaldo and Matthews 1999), which have been hypothesized in the literature as the two major substrate languages of Singapore English.","['kena-passives', 'active clause', 'chinese', 'baba malay', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

I will argue that, when available, the morphological passive will always be preferred over the periphrastic passive (which will be argued to follow from an economy principle). Swedish will be argued to be different from the other MLS languages in that it allows copying/agreeing of tense features on to a lower event projection located below a Voice/predicative head, which makes the morphological passive available in all tenses. Due to lack of this mechanism in the other MLS languages, the -s-passive will be unavailable in tensed context for these languages since it gives rise to a mirror violation.","['passive', 'nanosyntax', 'scandinavian', 'verb-phrase', 'periphrastic vs. morphological passives', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

However, studies on lexical concepts in cognitive psychology and philosophy and studies on the constitution of lexical items in linguistics have little contact with each other. We argue that current linguistic approaches that decompose lexical items into grammatical structures do not map naturally to plausible models of the corresponding concepts. In particular, we claim that roots, as the purported carriers of lexeme-specific content, cannot encapsulate the conceptual content of a lexical item. Instead, we distinguish syntactic from morphological roots: the former act as differential indices, and the latter are forms which may or may not correlate with a stable meaning. What expresses a lexical concept is a structure which can be of variable size. We explore the view that basic lexical items are syntactically complex but conceptually simplex, and that the structural meaning defined by a grammatical construction constrains the concept associated with it. This can lead to predictive hypotheses about the possible content of lexical items.","['root', 'atomism', 'decomposition', 'concept', 'dm', 'distributed morphology', 'categorization', 'categorizer', 'semantics', 'syntax']",2012
Cyclicity and non-cyclicity in Maltese: Local ordering of phonology and morphology in OT-CC,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001319/current.pdf?_s=zHCBS6-1br9F0H2_,"['Wolf, Matthew']","Stress in Maltese provides some of the foundational arguments for the cycle in phonology (Brame 1974). One piece of evidence for the cycle in Maltese occurs in perfective verbs with pronominal (object-marking) suffixes.  Here, syncope of vowels in unstressed, non-final open syllables underapplies in manner which suggests that, prior to object suffixation, there is a cycle of stress on the stem (plus the subject suffix, if any). Odden (1990, 1993) points out a paradoxical exception to this pattern: vowel-final (third weak radical) verbs with object suffixes fail to show this evidence of an inner-cycle stress. In this paper I propose an analysis of the asymmetry between C-final and V-final stems cast within Optimal Interleaving (OI: Wolf 2008), a theory of phonology-morphology interaction situated within McCarthy's (2007) OT with Candidate Chains. The analysis relies crucially on the fact that extrinsic ordering in OT-CC is enforced via pairwise ordering requirements (the PREC constraints) which are violable and potentially conflicting: normally Maltese requires that stress be assigned prior to object suffixation, but this is over-ridden with V-final stems by a requirement that stress assignment take place after (pre-suffixal) vowel lengthening. It has previously been noted (Wilson 2006; Wolf 2009, 2010) that OT-CC is able to produce such transitivity paradoxes in ordering, echoing in certain ways Anderson's (1969, 1974) theory of Local Ordering, which also treats ordering as a pairwise relation. The Maltese facts suggest that this ability is desirable in a theory of phonology-morphology ordering relations.","['maltese', 'cyclicity', 'local ordering', 'stress', 'syncope', 'candidate chains', 'optimal interleaving', 'ot-cc', 'oi', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2012

The Darkening of English /l/: A Stochastic Stratal OT Analysis,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001524/current.pdf?_s=Rlcsmce7vxQYM3fv,"['Turton, Danielle']","In present-day English, the phonological process of /l/-darkening displays a remarkable amount of variation depending on the position of its target in the word or phrase.  Syllable-based accounts state that light [l] occurs in onsets (e.g. _light_) and dark [l] in codas (e.g. _dull_). However, several studies, notably Hayes (2000), report overapplication of darkening to onset /l/ in certain morphosyntactically defined positions: e.g. word-finally in phrases such as _heal it_, and stem-finally before a suffix in words such as _heal-ing_.  These onset-position dark [l]s show that /l/-darkening is not just variable, but also sensitive to morphosyntactic structure.  This fact poses a particularly tough challenge for phonological theory: an adequate account of English /l/-darkening presupposes both a theory of the grammatical representation of phonological variation and a theory of the morphosyntax-phonology interface. 

Boersma & Hayes (2001) approach this problem by modelling Hayes's data in Stochastic Optimality Theory, using Output-Output Correspondence as their theory of the morphosyntax-phonology interface.  However, their approach is problematic as it predicts impossible grammars that can only be avoided by means of innate ranking stipulations.  Accordingly, this paper presents a reanalysis of Hayes's data using a novel combination of Stochastic and Stratal OT. I argue that this analysis is an improvement on Boersma & Hayes's parallel stochastic model because it does not rely on fixed innate constraint rankings and it does not generate impossible grammars. Moreover, I show that observations about the life cycle of phonological processes enable us to deduce quantitative predictions about the rate of /l/-darkening in different environments: in particular, the process should apply with lower frequency in smaller morphosyntactic domains, where it has been active for shorter periods of time. This prediction is corroborated by new data obtained by means of a novel method for determining cycle-specific rates of application of variable phonological processes.","['ssot', '/l/-darkening', 'variation', 'stochastic ot', 'stratal ot', 'variation in ot', 'life cycle of phonological processes', 'the russian doll theorem', 'phonology', 'morphology', 'morphosyntactic domains', 'opacity', 'ooc', 'phonology']",2012

Icelandic Morphosyntax and Argument Structure,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001506/current.pdf?_s=mpPlkiHXPCR8NS6P,"['Wood, Jim']","This dissertation is about the elements that build verbs, the elements that introduce arguments, and how these elements interact to determine the interpretation of arguments and events. A theory of argument structure is a theory how arguments are introduced syntactically, interpreted semantically, and marked morphologically, and how this information is linked to predicates and their morphological shape.  Through a detailed empirical study of Icelandic verbal alternations, this dissertation contributes to a line of research in which much of the work of argument structure is handled by the syntax, the component of language responsible for combining elements into larger structures, rather than a pre-syntactic lexicon. 


The major theoretical contribution of this thesis is a syntactic theory of argument structure which is much more syntactically autonomous than its closest relatives. The system proposed shares with construction-based approaches to argument structure the assumption that structures generate meanings independent of the lexical roots embedded in them. That is, lexical roots play a secondary role in effecting argument structures. However, it differs from most  syntactic approaches in that the syntax is far less deterministic of semantics, much as late insertion theories of morphology take syntax to underdetermine morphophonology.  


In the present theory, syntactic structure may underdetermine interpretation in three ways. First, a functional head may be compatible with multiple `allosemes', or denotations, which are decided post-syntactically on the basis of surrounding material. The categorial v head, for example, may have the interpretation of an activity or a cause (among other possible interpretations), depending on the interpretation of its complement. Second, a DP may be interpreted as an entity, or may be type-shifted to be interpreted as a (stative) eventuality. Third, a lexical root is associated with a web of possible semantic contributions, but the selection from among them is made on the basis of surrounding structure, after such structure has been built.","['anticausatives', 'middles', 'icelandic', '-st verbs', 'figure reflexives', 'reflexive verbs', 'applicatives', 'denominal verbs', 'causatives', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

It presents a detailed investigation of the scopal interaction between English negative indefinites, modals, and quantified phrases in ellipsis. One of the crucial observations is that a negative indefinite in object position cannot scope out of a verbal ellipsis site, while Quantifier Raising (QR) of a quantificational object can escape a verbal ellipsis site. 

This dissertation presents a unified account of this state of affairs in the context of multidominance. It is argued that both English negative indefinites and quantificational determiners decompose into two independent elements. Their formation is the result of a morphological process, Fusion Under Adjacency. The locality/adjacency required for fusion is established under remerge (multidominance), in combination with cyclic Spell-Out/linearization. The main claim of this dissertation is that the PF-process of ellipsis can block this morphological process. It is proposed that the timing of Fusion Under Adjacency and (derivational) ellipsis plays a crucial role: Fusion Under Adjacency has to take place before the ellipsis licensor is merged. The lack of a blocking effect of ellipsis in QR is accounted for by the fact that QR always has a landing site below the ellipsis licensor.

In addition to providing an account for the scopal behavior of quantificational elements under ellipsis, this dissertation also sheds new light on the syntax-to-PF mapping. It contributes to our understanding of how multidominant phrase markers are transferred to PF for (non-)pronunciation in a cyclic model of the grammar.

Instead, it requires recourse to an _operation_ -- one whose invocation is obligatory, but whose successful culmination is not enforced by the grammar.

Spanning,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001501/current.pdf?_s=nYkLhk2sbvxiZWet,"['Svenonius, Peter']","Spans are complement sequences of heads, e.g. if T selects VP as a complement, and V is the head of VP, then T-V is a span. That spans are a significant entity for syntax has been implicitly recognized in the Head Movement Constraint: A head may only move to the head selecting it, thus a head may only move within a span (e.g. V can move to T). Brody's Mirror theory goes so far as to equate spans with words (so if T and V do not form a word, then in that case VP is not the complement of T), replacing head movement with a linearization instruction for a complex head (e.g. a V-T word can spell out in V (English) or T (French)). This suggests a close connection between spell-out and spans, one which I develop in this paper. I claim the following: Spans are targets for morpheme insertion (so T-V could in principle be spelled out by a single morpheme, without any movement being necessary, and regardless of whether V also has a complement---contra Brody, a span is not necessarily a word). I develop this position through a close examination of a few portmanteau preposition-determiner forms in French (de+le=du, and à+le=au). The interaction of syntax and phonology in the selection of the correct allomorph sheds much light on the nature of spell-out and lexical insertion.","['spanning', 'spell-out', 'morphology', 'dm', 'distributed morphology', 'french', 'preposition', 'determiner', 'preposition-determiner fusion', 'allomorphy', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012
Russian Case Morphology and the Syntactic Categories,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001120/current.pdf?_s=_TKnl3Dah284HcJa,"['Pesetsky, David']","Sometimes it is the oddest facts that provide the best clues to significant properties of language, because their very oddity limits the space in which we are likely to search for possible explanations. In this paper, I argue that the strange behavior of Russian nominal phrases containing what are traditionally called the ""paucal numerals"" ('two', 'three' and 'four') provide clues of just this type concerning the syntactic side of morphological case.



When a nominal phrase like the Russian counterpart of 'these last two beautiful tables' occupies a nominative environment, the pre-numeral demonstrative and adjective ('these last') bear nominative plural morphology, and the numeral itself is nominative. The post- numeral adjective ('beautfiul'), however, is often genitive plural; and the noun ('table') is genitive singular -- a situation that the illustrious Russian grammarian Peshkovsky (1956) characterized as ""a typical example of the degree to which grammatical and logical thinking may diverge"".



I suggest that the behavior of these phrases is actually entirely logical -- once one adopts a particular structural analysis of the Russian DP. and a particular view of the nature of case morphology itself:  that the case affixes themselves -- traditionally classified using case-specific sui generis terminology (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, etc.)-- are actually instantiations of the various syntactic categories: D, N, P and V.  This proposal raises the possibility that there is no special theory of morphological case.","['russian', 'case', 'genitive', 'nominative', 'dative', 'accusative', 'oblique', 'numerals', 'paucal', 'number', 'slavic', 'syntax', 'morphology', 'nominals', 'dp', 'np', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

Accent in Uspanteko,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001468/current.pdf?_s=m-AGwuBBPQB54deV,"['Bennett, Ryan', 'Henderson, Robert']","Uspanteko (Guatemala; ~2000 speakers) is an endangered K'ichean-branch Mayan language. It is unique among the K'ichean languages in that, along with obligatory right-edge stress, Uspanteko has innovated a system of contrastive pitch accent.
 Word-level accent in Uspanteko is of theoretical interest for several reasons. First, it has a mixed accentual system with both stress and lexical pitch accent. Second, lexical pitch has striking effects on prosodic and segmental structure, interacting with stress shift, vowel length, vowel quality, and two deletion processes. Third, pitch accent is closely tied to morphology (especially possessive marking) even though the location of morphologically-derived tone is entirely a matter of surface phonology. Fourth, interactions between tone and vowel length provide evidence for lexical strata within
the accentual system of Uspanteko.
 In this paper we develop a novel analysis of Uspanteko accent, using data drawn
from previous research as well as our own recent fieldwork. We propose that the
location of pitch accent and stress in Uspanteko can be straightforwardly captured under three assumptions: (i) Uspanteko words contain a single right-aligned iamb; (ii) pitch accent must dock to the head of a foot; and (iii) pitch accent cannot dock to a word-final mora. These assumptions account for default word-final stress, as well as penultimate stress in [CVCV] words bearing pitch accent, which we treat as an iambic-trochaic foot form reversal. Interactions between prosody and segmental structure in Uspanteko are analyzed as the result of further constraints on foot shape, stress assignment, and tone non-finality. A surprising finding of this paper is that there is robust evidence for foot structure in Uspanteko, despite the fact that accent in
Uspanteko could easily be described in non-metrical terms. Finally, we model
accentual cophonologies in Uspanteko using partially-ordered prosodic constraints.","['accent', 'mayan', 'foot structure', 'cophonologies', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2012

Experimental investigations with native speakers of Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish reveal that this pattern is underlearned, and that speakers do not generalize it to novel forms, instead preferring the 2nd person singular as a base of derivation. The results implicate a role for naturalness biases in morphological structure, and an awareness that the first person singular is an unreliable and idiosyncratic base for productive inflectional identity.","['morphome', 'spanish', 'portuguese', 'italian', 'inflectional identity', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012
Latin rhotacism: a case study in the life cycle of phonological processes,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001760/current.pdf?_s=_lvlRr4syn73VzYK,"['Roberts, Philip']","Rhotacism in Latin is a well-known phonological generalisation which, in its paradigm cases, can be stated as a regular sound change of [s] to [r] between vowels.  This change/rule is posited on the basis both of comparative evidence, e.g. *swesor > Latin soror 'sister', and of paradigms in which final s alternates with medial intervocalic r, e.g. flos, floris 'flower'.  It is possible, however, to cite a number of exceptions to the basic rule, which, if one attempts to account for all of them in a synchronic grammar, amount to outright paradoxes. This paper presents a diachronic model of the progress of rhotacism through the expected life-cycle of a phonological process, within the formalism of Stratal Optimality Theory, and demonstrates that this model can account for the exceptions to rhotacism as epiphenomena of the expected progress of the constraint ranking giving rise to it from phrase- to word-level, and from word- to stem-level. Finally, I argue that rhotacism became a systematic property of the lexicon, at which point it was subject to analogical extension, giving the paradigm levelling observed in e.g. honor, honoris 'honour' (formerly honos, honoris).","['latin', 'phonology', 'morphology', 'rhotacism', 'historical linguistics', 'amphichronic linguistics', 'life cycle of phonological generalisations', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2012
Head-marking inflection and the architecture of grammatical theory: Evidence from reduplication and compounding in Hiaki (Yaqui),https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001530/current.pdf?_s=5QbfgL1_qlp_54yH,"['Haugen, Jason D.', 'Harley, Heidi']","Within generative grammar, noun incorporation and other compounding processes have traditionally been the focus of morpho-syntacticians, while reduplication has been investigated primarily by morpho-phonologists. The interaction of these two phenomena in a single language has significant implications that go beyond the narrow concerns of these two sub-domains, bearing much more broadly on the architecture of grammatical theory. This paper investigates the interactions of reduplication and compounding within one language, Hiaki (Yaqui). Reduplication for aspectual inflection in Hiaki occurs inside of compounds and other derived words, marking the head of the word. We demonstrate the major architectural issues resting on the analysis of these phenomena by examining how different theoretical perspectives can (or cannot) accommodate the Hiaki data. Architectures which separate inflection and derivation into separate grammatical components (Weak Lexicalist theories) cannot account for the data, while theories maintaining the two processes in the same component fare better but tend to require some supplemental architectural accommodations. Strong Lexicalist theories and Paradigm Function Morphology can account for head-marking reduplication in Hiaki, but other data from the language problematize major premises of these theories. The syntacticocentric approach we advocate also requires supplementation (Local Dislocation) to correctly position inflectional reduplicants inside compound verb forms, but this is a well-established and independently motivated mechanism within the Distributed Morphology framework.","['inflection', 'head-marking', 'reduplication', 'noun incorporation', 'compounding', 'hiaki (yaqui)', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

Under the first account, the definite marker _ha_ is a D head selecting the adjective it marks for definiteness (similarly to nouns) (e.g. Sichel 2002); under the second account, the definite marker is a syntactic definiteness feature inherent to the noun or determiner, which spreads to other elements in the DP (e.g. Borer 1996).

In this paper, I present novel data from degree modification of coordinated adjectives in Hebrew and Arabic. I show that the scope ambiguities and definiteness marking patterns in various structures provide evidence for an analysis whereby definiteness is a syntactic feature that surfaces as the phrasal clitic _ha-_ ‘the’. In addition, I show that the structure-sensitive, though post-syntactic, morphological operation of LOCAL DISLOCATION generates the correct distribution of the Hebrew and Arabic definite marker, namely it being a phrasal proclitic occurring at the left-edge of phrases, as well as the intricate pattern of definiteness agreement in Hebrew and Arabic attributive adjectives.","['coordination', 'local dislocation', 'adjectives', 'degree modifiers', 'definite marker', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

For instance, Haugen (2009) and Mateu (2011) assume a special syntactic operation through which manner is syntactically generated, called conflation, in which manner is introduced by a root which externally merges with the verbal head by head adjunction. One (partial) exception to this tendency is found in Zubizarreta and Oh (2007), who treat the manner component in languages like Korean as a structural complex headed by a lexical verb, which enters a serial verb construction with another verb. This paper offers a series of arguments in favor of the view that the manner component universally presents a bare unergative VP. A consequence is that syntactic explanations for the behavior of manner-expressing verbs have to be formulated in a different way, which does not crucially rely on the atomic status of manner. The paper argues that the model that Zubizarreta & Oh (2007) designed for Korean, involving a verb with a complement adjoined to the lexical verb, is also the correct analysis for the observed phenomena in the Indo-European type of languages, and perhaps even a universal model of manner-expressing verbs.",['639 times'],2012

Finally, deletion in disyllables was rated higher than deletion in monosyllables, reflecting the trends in the lexicon.

  Building on Kayne 1994:19-21, I argue that the change leading to the mirror order is due to the movement and the consequent left-adjunction of the dative clitic to the accusative one. According to Kayne’s terminology, the resulting configuration is a true cluster, while the other clitic combinations were split. On the basis of data from Italo-Romance vernaculars, I show that the clusters with the mirror order differ from the others under a series of syntactic and morpho-phonological aspects, which ultimately support the cluster vs split distinction.",['473 times'],2012
TAM Split Ergativity,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001457/current.pdf?_s=Yw5hTP2Mg5AH8Wt7,"['Coon, Jessica']","This article surveys empirical and theoretical work on Tense-Aspect-Mood (“TAM”) based split ergativity, and offers an account for how it arises. While these splits are typically assumed to represent a unified phenomenon, I demonstrate that non-ergative portions of split systems exhibit different patterns, and argue that these reflect at least two different processes which trigger the splits: (i) non-perfective aspects are more likely to be built on complex auxiliary constructions, and (ii) imperfectivity is associated with demoted objects or lower transitivity. Both motivations trigger the same result: in the “split” portions of the grammar the transitive subject is not marked with ergative case because it is not a transitive subject. This structural account of split ergativity allows us to avoid positing different variable feature inventories on the same functional head (cf. Ura 2006), and also provides a straight-forward account of the so-called “counter-universal” splits (Gildea and de Castro Alves 2010), which cause problems for purely functionalist accounts (e.g. DeLancey 1981). Furthermore, it is shown that the factors which trigger these splits are not limited to ergative languages, but are present cross-linguistically—they are not visible in nominative-accusative systems because (by definition) there is no visible difference between transitive and intransitive subjects. The prevalence of splits in ergative systems is thus not taken to reflect any deep instability of ergativity.","['ergativity', 'split ergativity', 'aspect', 'transitivity', 'typology', 'universals', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

Nominal Roots as Event Predicates in English Denominal Conversion Verbs,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001440/current.pdf?_s=aJtjHh0XjDtGndxf,"['Rimell, Laura']","Despite the high productivity in English of denominal verb formation by conversion, a constraint on possible interpretations is identified: intransitive denominal conversion verbs are infelicitous where the
source nominal is intended to be an incremental theme (#apple 'eat apple'), a patient (#shirt 'wear shirt'), or the holder of a result state (#window 'open window').  This little-studied constraint is compared to a well-known constraint on denominal conversion verbs in which the source nominal is intended as an agent or cause (#it cowed a calf 'the cow had a calf', Hale and Keyser, 1993), accounted for in previous literature by a prohibition on incorporation in sublexical syntax from specifier position. To account for both constraints it is proposed that nominal roots in English denominal conversion verbs do not originate in argument position, but adjoin directly to subeventual heads, and are interpreted as predicates of events. A prediction is made that English denominal conversion verbs should exhibit the same argument and event structure possibilities as verbs built from verbal roots, which is confirmed by a corpus study of 250 verbs from each class. Nominal roots, however, have a significantly higher likelihood of being lexicalized as transitive verbs than verbal roots do. A study is further undertaken of the semantics of English denominal conversion verbs, resulting in a reformulation of Kiparsky's (1997) Canonical Use Constraint; specifically, it is proposed that a canonical event type associated with a nominal root can be a default interpretation for a denominal conversion verb if and only if the argument structure template of the canonical event type can be unified with the arguments of the denominal verb. The role of pragmatics in the interpretion of English denominal conversion verbs is considered, and it is suggested that apparent exceptions to the constraint on themes, patients, and result states can be attributed to re-interpretation of the verb as an agent-oriented manner verb.","['denominal verb', 'conversion', 'canonical use constraint', 'argument structure', 'corpus study', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2012

the motivations and mechanisms of semantic change in grammaticalization

semantic change and reductive formal changes, on the other. Speaker-oriented
inferences have significant consequences, leading to the relaxation of
selectional restrictions on a construction. In turn, the relaxation of selectional
restrictions can create conditions in which the type and token frequency of a
construction can rise considerably. Furthermore, changes in the selectional
restrictions on a construction can themselves catalyze semantic change by
coercing listeners into new form–function pairings. This framework is applied
to allative futures, a typological comparative concept developed in order to
compare structurally diverse future tenses. Following the typological
discussion, a diachronic case study of the emergence and grammaticalization

allative futures provide evidence against assumptions that purpose constructions
as such are not grammaticalized as future tense constructions (Schmidtke-

Blackjack! 21 arguments that Agreeing Adjectives are Derived Nominals,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003591/current.pdf?_s=n3nbbnC_9oVit9Ca,"['Emonds, Joseph']","Adjectives in many Indo-European languages morphologically agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number and case (if the language’s nouns can differ in case). These agreeing items seem to undermine several otherwise broad generalizations about morphology, word order and phrasal stress. Mysteriously, agreement in Germanic languages is limited to pre-nominal attributes, while all adjectives agree in Romance and Slavic languages. 
This essay proposes to analyze adjectival agreement in terms of a “Derived Nominal Hypothesis,” which assigns agreeing adjectives a word-internal nominal structure whose head is the agreement suffix itself. Consequently, these “adjectives” are actually Nouns (by Lieber’s Right Hand Head Rule), and so qualify as unexceptional heads of NPs. This supports Abney’s controversial conjecture for pre-nominal attributive adjectives (that they are heads of NPs). The Derived Nominal Hypothesis additionally succeeds in making several traditional observations on the behavior of agreeing adjectives fully compatible with current explanatory grammatical theory. It also accounts for many previously puzzling morphological properties of agreement and its syntactic distribution in those languages on which the study primarily focuses, namely Dutch, German, Latin and Czech. To a lesser extent, the essays toches on English adjectival word order and on common properties of Spanish and Latin agreement.

The mapping of left-branching and right-branching structure shows asymmetry in the strengths of juncture. This junctural asymmetry comes from the phonetic implementation of speech signals. It is argued that the strong juncture in left-branching structure makes it quasi-compound. Unmarked word-stress location works as a constraint on complement movement, deriving left-branching from right-branching structure in the base, thus taking the place of a head-directionality parameter.

However, it is clear that just as there can be head-movement without affixation, there can be affixation without head-movement. Even the issue of which morpheme orders can properly be taken as 'mirroring' the syntax is somewhat more complex in implementation than commonly assumed. In addition to the mirroring options available, additional mechanisms must be at work in deriving certain types of complex forms. An analysis of the Cupeño verbal complex is argued to involve an intricate interplay of independently motivated possibilities. Finally, some of the formal problems posed by the usual head-adjunction analysis of head movement are reviewed, and a brief overview of some alternative theoretical approaches to head-movement is given.","['cupeño', 'the extension condition', 'merger under adjacency', 'm-merger', 'cyclicity', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2011

In chapter 1, I argue on the basis of novel data from Uyghur that noun phrases bearing structural case can still be eligible for raising. I show that raising in Uyghur is EPP-driven, and does not trigger overt agreement. Thus, we must either conclude that pure EPP movement does not depend on Agree (cf. Richards 2009, a.o.), or abandon the Activity Condition proposed by Chomsky (1998, 2001). I suggest that phenomena that have been attributed to the Activity Condition can be reanalyzed by means of other principles, such as the Phase Impenetrability Condition (Chomsky 1998, 2001).

In chapter 2 (based on joint work with Jeremy Hartman), I argue in favor of Chomsky’s (2001) weak version of the Phase Impenetrability Condition, and against Chomsky’s (1998) stronger version of the Phase Impenetrability Condition more commonly assumed. The argument is based on case assignment and agreement in n Uyghur genitive subject constructions. I furthermore suggest that adopting Chomsky’s (2001) version of the Phase Impenetrability Condition makes the concept of a weak phase head unnecessary (cf. Richards 2009).

In chapter 3, I propose that quirky case in Faroese is not assigned immediately when a noun phrase enters the derivation. Rather, Faroese quirky case depends on a higher functional projection. This helps explain why quirky case-marked noun phrases in Faroese can trigger number agreement and dependent case licensing, and why quirky case can fail to be assigned in Faroese passive and raising constructions.

'For' in English infinitives has nothing to do with Case,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004432/current.pdf?_s=5QYAnrPhri_-3peV,"['McFadden, Thomas']","The distribution of 'for' in English infinitives has for some time been thought to be regulated in large part by its role in assigning syntactic Case to a following overt subject and as such played an important role in the development of Case theory. This paper reconsiders the full range of facts from standard contemporary English, along with a detailed examination of diachronic, dialectal and comparative evidence. The picture that emerges is that a Case-based account is untenable. The clearest parallels to the distribution of 'for' are actually found with that of overt 'that', which is not traditionally thought to be related to Case. The fact that 'for' only appears before overt subjects can then be related to the COMP-trace effect -- which holds for both 'for' and 'that' and essentially rules out an overt complementizer before a silent subject position. The question then is what regulates the overt distribution of complementizers to yield these effects. The later parts of the paper argue that the outlines of the restrictions, in particular the clear relevance of overtness of both the complementizer and what follows it, point toward the relevance of prosodic restrictions. A suggestive proposal along these lines is made, building on An (2007)'s Intonational Phrase Edge Generalization, which places requirements on overt material in the mapping from syntactic structures to prosodic domains.","['for-to infinitives', 'case', 'comp-trace effects', 'prosody', 'middle english', 'cartography', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2011
BE-ing Default: the Morphosyntax of Auxiliaries [phdthesis],https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001354/current.pdf?_s=cXgRW840PkNsMrMw,"['Bjorkman, Bronwyn']","In this dissertation I argue that auxiliary verbs, particularly auxiliary BE, arise as a reflex of general morphosyntactic processes of verbal inflection, rather than due to arbitrary factors such as syntactic selection. More specifically, I propose that auxiliary verbs reflect a failure of the inflectional system to unite inflectional material with a main verb. This failure occurs when inflectional features are not structurally local to the main verb and are thus ""stranded"". If stranded inflectional features are affixal, they trigger the insertion of a totally default verb (BE) within the morphological component, much as in the traditional analysis of DO-support framed in terms of the Stray Affix Filter (Lasnik, 1981). I frame the structural locality constraints on inflection  in terms of Agree (Chomsky 1998, et seq.), but I adopt a “reverse” formulation of Agree in order to allow inflectional feature values to be passed downward from functional heads onto the main verb. This approach contributes to an increasing body of recent work arguing that a ""reversed"" directionality for Agree must be available (Baker 2008, Zeijlstra 2010, Wurmbrand 2011, a.o.). Subsequent chapters extend this general approach into a variety of related domains: the alternation between HAVE and BE in auxiliary selection, the conflict between this analysis of BE and the traditional analysis of DO-support as a process that rescues stranded inflection, and the interaction of verbal inflection and auxiliaries with counterfactual inflection marking.","['syntax', 'morphology', 'verbal inflection', 'auxiliary verbs', 'auxiliary selection', 'counterfactuals', 'do-support', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2011

In a broader perspective, the paper makes a step towards a general view that all lexical verbs are syntactically derived by incorporation of their arguments, and consequently that all lexical verbs involve a complex syntactic structure.","['manner-incorporation', 'cognate objects', 'verb prefixation', 'manner-result complementarity', 'serbo-croatian', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2011

In typical nominative-accusative languages, nominative case is not assigned by finite T or by agreement with any functional head. Rather, even in prototypical subject position it is the default case, showing up when the conditions for the assignment of all other cases are not met. The appearance of a dependency is due to a confusion of conditions on nominative case with conditions on the overtness of subjects. Conditions on overtness and case-marking tend to coincide, but a careful look at the data shows that they are orthogonal to each other, and that the latter has more to do with conditions on coreference which in itself is a function of modes of clausal selection and degree of clausal dependency.

In Old Romanian, the suffixed definite article variably occurs either on the first or on a lower [+N] constituent (noun or adjective), so that an indefinite adjective may precede the definite noun. In contrast, in Modern Romanian, it is always the first noun which bears the definite article, while, in case an adjective precedes the noun, the definite article occurs on the adjective. The existence of this lower (definite) article raises several questions (the contexts where it occurs, its significance for the emergence of the enclitic definite article, etc.), to which this paper provides tentative answers. We propose that the existence of a lower definite article combined with a tendency for economy made possible the extension of the use of the article to (pre-nominal) adjectives, gradually leading to stricter conditions in the valuation of definiteness in Modern Romanian (Local Agree). At the same time, the lower article is evidence that the Romanian enclitic definite article originates in a post-posed demonstrative.","['""low"" definite article', 'long distance agree', 'definiteness valuation', 'dp-structure', 'syntactic change', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2011

This predicts that suppletive allomorphy of inner material cannot be sensitive to the phonological properties of outer material. The claimed non-existence of such outwards-sensitive allomorph selection has been cited as an argument for a strictly serial approach and against parallel Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky 2004 [1993]), where the form of an entire word is computed at once and hence outwards sensitivity is freely permitted.

In this paper I argue that a purely serial model of allomorph selection cannot be correct, because outwards-sensitivity is not completely unattested. At the same time, the space of attested examples is limited enough that a purely parallel model is clearly under-restrictive. I argue further that the circumstances where outwards phonological sensitivity does become possible are correctly predicted under a version of Optimal Interleaving (Wolf 2008), a theory of phonology-morphology interaction cast within McCarthy's (2007) OT with Candidate Chains. In OT-CC, the grammar constructs a set of harmonically-improving derivations, which compete against one another as candidates. With respect to phonological operations, OT-CC's Local Optimality requirement dictates that changes which violate the same basic faithfulness constraint must compete locally, in the course of chain construction. This paper amends the original version of OI by proposing that Local Optimality for morph-insertion is similar: different morph-insertions must compete locally (are subject to Local Optimality) when they would violate the same (possibly empty) sets of faithfulness constraints on morpheme-morph correspondence. This predicts that local competition is suspended, and thus that outwards sensitivity becomes possible, in cases where one of the competing allomorphs is unfaithful relative to the morphosyntactic input in ways that the other is not. I argue, based on examples from Western Armenian and Kayardild, that this prediction is borne out. I also discuss how phonologically-conditioned allomorphy of roots (which is by definition outwards-looking) can be made sense of in OI.","['allomorph selection', 'candidate chains', 'ot-cc', 'optimal interleaving', 'oi', 'lookahead', 'armenian', 'kayardild', 'morphology', 'phonology']",2011

Although I will not adopt all the details of the Distributed Morphology framework, I will try to follow the leading idea that morphology is “syntax all the way down” (Marantz 1997). Specifically, I will adhere as far as possible to the Single Engine Hypothesis, the idea that complex morphological objects (i.e. derived words of various kinds) are constructed in the same way as complex syntactic objects, by the iteration of binary (internal or external) Merge. The principal focus here will be on the extent to which head-movement/incorporation (as well as phrasal movement, see Julien 2002 and below) plays a role in constructing complex words, and how FOFC interacts with these processes. Accordingly the main focus will be on inflectional morphology.

More specifically, it focuses on two domains: the lexical projection and categorial features. Analogously, it consists of two parts. The first part argues that the features of lexical vocabulary items are not an active part of the syntactic derivation (cf. Borer 2005). I provide empirical support for the claim that vocabulary items are not present in syntax. Consequently, lexical nodes canot be defined through the merger of a lexical vocabulary item. Furthermore, lexical vocabulary items cannot determine the (sub)category of the projection. Instead, this dissertation adopts the view that syntax operates on UG-features only. It argues that the root terminal node is a by-product of the operation Merge that is characterized by the mere absence of features (cf. De Belder & van Craenenbroeck 2011). It further shows that functional structure determines subcategories. In the second part of the thesis I argue against the existence of categorial heads. It is generally assumed that derivational affixes realize categorial heads (see for example Marchand 1969, Williams 1981, Selkirk 1982 and Halle and Marantz 1993, amongst many others). I argue against this view and propose instead that derivational affixes realize root positions. I show that the meaning of derivational affixes is lexical and hence propose to treat them as lexical rather than functional vocabulary items. Furthermore, I show that the same descriptive and explanatory adequacy can be obtained without postulating categorial heads. The conclusion of both parts is that lexical categorial features are no longer a primitive of syntax.

I examine the morpho-syntactic structure of expressions of Goal (to the house), Source (from the house), Route (through the house), as well as path expressions of the type up to the house and away from the house. I develop a fine-grained path typology comprising eight different types of paths and conclude that they have different complexity. Precisely, Source expressions are formed on the basis of Goal expressions, Route expressions are formed on the basis of Source expressions. Similarly, paths without transitions (towards, away from) are formed on the basis of the corresponding transitional path (to, from) and paths with delimitation (up tom starting from) are formed on the basis of the corresponding ""ordinary"" Goal or Source path.

Assuming that morphological complexity is reflected in syntax, I take this containment relationship to indicate that the syntactic structure of Route expressions embeds the structure of Source expressions, which embed Goal expressions. Similarly, non-transitional and delimited paths embed the corresponding transitional path. This leads me to decomposing the Path head, argued to be present in directional phrases, into five distinct heads: Goal, Source, Route, Scale and Bound. I propose a semantic function for each particular head.

I explore the lexicalization of the decomposed Path structure and show how it captures the
morphological make-up and diversity of directional expressions across languages, as well as the
restrictions which apply to them. In this, I follow the Nanosyntax framework and develop an idea
recently put forward by M. Starke that the entries stored in the lexicon can trigger syntactic movements
in order for Spell-out to take place. 

In the final part of the thesis, I investigate the various predictions made by the decomposed path structure and the lexicalization theory I assume. Specifically, I explore the possible and impossible
lexicalization patterns and syncretisms between the various spatial roles and show that the system
correctly captures the attested ones and bans the unattested ones.","['path', 'goal', 'source', 'route', 'location', 'nanosyntax', 'decomposition', 'case', 'syncretism', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2011
The destiny of roots in Blackfoot and Lithuanian,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001613/current.pdf?_s=MYCPkFFEH_FjFwmQ,"['Armoskaite, Solveiga']","Roots and their categorization constitute a fundamental aspect of knowledge about the structure of language. Essentially, the categorization of roots serves to classify linguistic information. In this dissertation I explore the categorization of roots in Blackfoot (Algonquian) and Lithuanian (Baltic), languages which are unrelated typologically or genetically. 
 Relying on the interaction between roots and affixes, I develop language specific diagnostics necessary to establish the categorial affiliation of a given root. I show that all Blackfoot roots are uniquely associated with a particular category, i.e. they are categorized. Meanwhile, Lithuanian roots split into two types: some are categorized, and some are category-neutral. This variation in the categorization of roots requires an explanation. 
 I propose that the categorial destiny of a root is determined by (i) a category intrinsic feature c (such as e.g., animacy, gender, transitivity, and degree); and (ii) the categorization structure hosting the feature c. 
 There are two sources of variation: i) the origin of the feature c; and ii) the content of the feature c. Roots that are endowed with the feature c prior to syntax are of a unique category; roots that attain their feature c in syntax are category-neutral. In addition, the content of feature c may differ across languages. 
 According to this proposal, the notion of category is not a primitive but a construct.","['roots', 'feature', 'gender', 'categorization', 'algonquian', 'blackfoot', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2011
Labels and Structures,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001252/current.pdf?_s=2A3Xxca3MswE56gc,"['Adger, David']","In this chapter, I motivate a new approach to the derivation of structure and its labeling. I do this by removing a stipulation from the definition of Merge, and by replacing functional categories qua lexical items with a function that directly labels structures. The removal of the stipulation in Merge allows unary branching structures which, in the new system, provide the structural carapace for sequences of (mainly functional)  categories; the labeling function recurses from the categories assigned to roots, assigning labels to ever larger structures on the basis of a universally given sequence of  categories (Cinque 1999, Starke (2001), obviating the need for functional heads. Unary branching labeled structures provide the locus for morphological realization so that what were previously considered to be functional lexical items are, in the new system, just spellouts of pieces of labeled structure. Standard binary Merge then provides the further structure necessary for negotiating the syntactic and semantic connections between sequences of categories. Part of the motivation for setting up the system in this way is that it provides us with a solution to a serious problem in the derivation of current phrase structural representations: how structures containing base generated specifiers are labeled. However, the system I develop also rules out a certain class of rollup and remnant movement analyses, replacing them with base generated `flipped' structures (Brody 2000, Adger Habour and Watkins 2009), reducing the analytical options available to syntactic structure building in a desirable way.","['labels', 'specifiers', 'extended projection', 'argument introduction', 'minimalist syntax', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2011
Reduplication in Distributed Morphology,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001363/current.pdf?_s=AGLpwHOIAEVOy9BS,"['Haugen, Jason D.']","The two extant approaches to reduplication in Distributed Morphology (DM) are: (i) the readjustment approach, where reduplication is claimed to result from a readjustment operation on some stem triggered by a (typically null) affix; and (ii) the affixation approach, where  reduplication is claimed to result from the insertion of a special type of Vocabulary Item (i.e. a reduplicative affix—“reduplicant” or “Red”) which gets inserted into a syntactic node in order to discharge some morphosyntactic feature(s), but which receives its own phonological content from some other stem (i.e. its “base”) in the output. This paper argues from phonologically-conditioned allomorphy pertaining to base-dependence, as in the case of durative reduplication in Tawala, that the latter approach best accounts for a necessary distinction between “reduplicants” and “bases” as different types of morphemes which display different phonological effects, including “the emergence of the unmarked” effects, in many languages.  I also defend a blended model of DM which incorporates a constraint-based Correspondence Theoretic vision of Phonological Form. In this model the syntax builds morphological structure as per standard DM assumptions, which in turn leads to local and cyclic restrictions on allomorph selection, as argued in Embick 2010.  I argue contra Embick 2010, however, that the phonology must be an essential part of the grammar in order to account for surface form-oriented (or “output-centered”) prosodic morphology such as reduplication and mora affixation. The output of Morphological Structure thus serves as an input into PF, which I construe as Optimality Theoretic tableaux as in Correspondence Theory, thus accounting for surface-oriented phonological copying effects like base-dependence.","['reduplication', 'distributed morphology', 'allomorphy', 'reduplicative allomorphy', 'base-dependence', 'hiaki (yaqui)', 'tawala', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'phonology']",2011

In particular, the reason why the construct state marker w- never occurs with the gender marker t- remains unclear, despite of several studies mostly syntactic. This paper argues that the construct state marker w- and the feminine marker t- compete for the same templatic position. Within the standard DP projection, it is proposed that a templatic CV site hosts gender t- under the nP. When raised to D, this site has no C position available for the construct state w-, yielding forms where only the feminine marker is realized. The same reasoning holds in the causative imperfective formations. The association of the causative prefix with the templatic site under the vP explains the absence of aspect markers in the verb. Extended to the case of Classical Arabic verb conjugation, the competition hypothesis allows us to explain why reflexive n- never co-occurs with medial consonant gemination; though semantically viable, nkassara 'it shuttered' is ruled out because reflexive n-, generated lower in the structure than intensive gemination, fills the only C position provided by the derivational CV. The advocated analysis has implications for the way syntax, morphology and phonology interact: templates are indeed argued to mediate the interaction between components of Grammar. Handled in syntactic structure, templates allow unifying standard phonological, morphological and syntactic accounts of the co-occurrence restrictions examined in this paper.","['berber', 'tashlhiyt', 'construct state', 'definitness', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2011

The relationship between the null noun and the verb it is the notional object of is just like the relationship between the noun and the verb in what I call Noun-Verb verbs, produced as a result of processes such as noun incorporation, noun stripping or denominal verb formation. The argument is based on the semantic similarities between implicit indefinite objects and the nouns in these other constructions. The results of this research are important not only from a linguistic perspective, but from a philosophy of language perspective as well, as implicit indefinite objects have been taken to constitute evidence for the existence of pragmatic enrichment, a claim that is argued against here.","['implicit objects', 'pragmatic enrichment', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2011

Such a paradigm of
verb-doubling poses a strong case against iconicity, because knowing where a verb can double requires full information about the entire derivation of the sentence. The sentence is correct if and only if the tensed element is not at the left-edge of the sentence. The infinitive form of the analytic construction prevents the tensed element from occurring in the most left-edge position. This paper proposes that the analytic structure (to.know I.do) responds to the same trigger as expletive insertion (expl I.know). I claim that analytic tense formation is a
last-resort strategy that forms the equivalent of an expletive by excorporation of the verbal root out of the complex tensed head. The excorporated lexical verb appears fronted as an infinitive form by default. The tensed auxiliary is either realized as a dummy ‘do’ auxiliary (to.know I.do), or, for an idiosyncratic list of verbs, as the tensed reiteration of the excorporated verb itself (doubling; to.know I.know).","['post-syntactic rules', 'dm', 'verb-doubling', 'excorporation', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2011

I examine the properties of the null wh’s and compare them to the overt wh’s in Wolof.  I provide evidence that the null wh’s, like the overt wh’s, move successive cyclically and may trigger agreement on intermediate complementizers that occur in the movement pathway.

It is argued that the semantic effects of prefixes, their morpho-syntactic behavior and the asymmetries between the so-called external and internal prefixes are best captured by an analysis based on multiple relativization. A counterpart of the raising analysis of multiple relatives is formulated in the verbal domain, where aspectual relative clauses modify the highest aspectual head, and head movement of the aspect head triggers agreement between the bounder (PP specifying the bounds that induce telicity) and the lexical verb that head moves. This agreement is marked by prefixes, which therefore correspond to the respective prepositions. The analysis has a wider empirical coverage than its predecessors, but it also contributes to some more general theoretical claims: that all the type recursion in language stems from relativization, that relativization is a general syntactic strategy which parametrically occurs in different categorial domains, and that lexical verbs, just like lexical nouns (hence open classes in general) do not take complements.","['verb prefixation', 'aspect', 'operator movement', 'multiple relativization', 'agreement', 'slavic', 'serbo-croatian', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2010

The Georgian language provides a particularly acute set of challenges to linguists in the way it questions received assumptions about grammatical functions, thematic relations, and natural language categorization.  

This dissertation tackles these facts by examining first what the evidence for different domains of grammar are in Georgian. How do data from Georgian verb morphology challenge traditional assumptions underlying lexical incremental assumptions behind the morpheme? Do inversion facts argue for monostratal or multistratal conceptualizations of grammatical functions? 

The answer to both of these questions is highly complicated, and requires an extensive look at the Georgian systems of case, agreement, tense, aspect, and modality.  In particular I assess the viability of classical treatments such as Harris (1982), Anderson (1993), Marantz (1992), and Stump (2001) and find that Georgian poses problems for each one.  I go on to assess in the second part how differential feature hierarchies in morphology versus syntax argue for the existence of distinct feature geometries.  Feature hierarchies, it turns out, are epiphenomena of set-theoretical properties of these geometries.

In the literature, the general assumption is that the linear position of an affix determines whether it phonologically integrates with the base or not: prefixes do not integrate, and suffixes do, unless they are independent phonological words. Here we will argue in favour of an alternative account where, just as in syntactic phrases, the phonological properties follow from the internal constituency of words. We propose that, independently of their linear position with respect to the base, an affix is phonologically independent from it when they do not belong to the same Command Unit (CU). Phonological integration between base and affix takes place when both elements are inside the same CU. This proposal is argued for on the basis of the behaviour of diminutive affixes in Spanish, German and Czech.

I argue that the ``anti-reflexive'' reading is not triggered by the presence of a subject PRO or pro, but rather by the absence of reflexive marking, i.e. overt marking that functions to recode lexically specified co-reference relations between the arguments of a predicate. I argue that nominalizations and participles are structurally fairly rich, and that the relation between ``full'' verbs and nominalizations and participles is fairly transparent. I further argue that the verb-phrase needs to be decomposed into at least two subparts/subevents and that each sub-event carries information about the participants involved in it (as in e.g. Pustejovsky 1995 and Ramchand 2008).  I will further argue that there basically is no difference between using a reflexive pronoun to create a reflexive reading and using a reflexive pronoun to form an anti-causative reading -- it's all about re-coding the co-ference relations between the arguments of a predicate. The article also shows that phenomena like participle formation, nominalizations and argument ``reduction'' can all be handled in the syntax if we follow the so-called superset principle of lexical insertion.

The Morphosyntax of Camfranglais and the 4-M Model,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001448/current.pdf?_s=c_vQ_2gzVeLDkV-q,"['Nchare, Abdoulaye Laziz']","This paper investigates the morphosyntactic features of borrowed verbs attested in written French-based code-switching (CS) as used in online forums by bilingual Cameroonians residing in Europe and the USA. I focus on the structural rather than the functional aspect of online CS. I discuss the distributional features of inflected and non-inflected borrowed verbs in order to determine which structural pattern of CS is predominant in the corpus. My objective is to contribute to the empirical and descriptive study of CS among Cameroonian internet users. The assumptions adopted in this paper are based on Myers-Scotton’s (2002, 2008) 4-M model of morphemes classification in CS data. I seek to uncover a number of constraints that account for when Embedded Language (EL) elements in bilingual speech may take Matrix Language (ML) inflection and when they may surface as bare forms. This question is especially relevant with regards to verbs. While Myers-Scotton does invoke the congruence hypothesis, her writings do not work this out sufficiently. In the case of Camfranglais (the term used to describe the data I am investigating), there is a further interest because CS ordinarily entails a ML-EL pair but here there is a ML (French) and multiple EL’s, specifically English, Pidgin, Duala, and Ewondo. The findings of this study are consistent with 4-M model predictions (at least for finite verbs and present participles) in that all grammatical morphemes and word order are that of French, the dominant language that sets the morphosyntactic frame of the clause in Camfranglais. However, the congruence hypothesis does not explain why bare forms overwhelmingly occur in Camgfranglais data. Using quantitative data concerning the structural distribution of EL verbs in Camfranglais, I show that the model proposed here has more explanatory power than the 4-M model in regards to the existence of bare forms.","['borrowed verbs', 'code-switching', '4-m model', 'congruence', 'matrix language', 'embedded language', 'bare verbs', 'inflected verbs', 'french', 'duala', 'ewondo', 'pidgin', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2010

Chameleon probes: third cycle Agree effects in Mordvin,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002307/current.pdf?_s=IvWkGvvYWtf236ml,"['Georgi, Doreen']","In this paper I argue that a probe which searches for a value of feature X can exceptionally be valued by a feature Y if (i) X and Y form a natural class and if (ii) massive probe impoverishment, as suggested in Béjar (2003), applies. I call a probe that is valued by a different feature than the feature it originally probed for a ""chameleon probe"". As a consequence of massive impoverishment, the probe is underspecified for the exact feature it searches for and can thus be valued by any member of the natural class of features. I exemplify this phenomenon in the Uralic language Mordvin, where a number probe can be valued by a person feature if both arguments of a transitive verb are singular, leading to a third cycle of Agree in Béjar’s (2003) system. The chameleon probe approach derives the unexpected distribution of person markers in a subpart

The central question to pose is whether such 3/4-patterns underlyingly are significant for the Faculty of Language or whether they simply are epiphenomena without further meaning or implications. In this article I argue that linguistic structures are sets of sets of purely privative atomic features which display surface phenomena such as asymmetries or skewings as a consequence of underlying feature interaction; I call this the Atomic Feature Conjecture. I suggest that features are combined by means of Merge and I demonstrate that there are three types of feature relationships: independence, dependence and antagonism. As far as asymmetry is concerned, I define two types of asymmetrical patterns: Type B, simultaneous incompatibility; and Type M, feature dependence. I furthermore outline consequences of these findings for Linguistic Theory, emphasising, on the one hand, the importance of privative features, and, on the other hand, the notion of the empty set as a fundamental component of the computational system. Ultimately, I also address remaining theoretical dilemmas stemming from the proposal and discuss future directions that cross-disciplinary research within the field could take.","['linguistic theory', 'biolinguistics', 'language patterns', 'cognition', 'language faculty', 'features', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'semantics']",2010

Standard Indonesian presents an important testing ground for this theory due to its syntatically governed distribution of the active voice morphology (Cole and Hermon 1998): the movement of an NP across a verb with the active voice prefix meN- results in the obligatory deletion of the prefix from the verb. In examples of obligatory control in this language, the prefix cannot be deleted but rather must be retained in the control verb. These examples thus provide important morphosyntactic evidence against the movement theory of control in Indonesian.","['movement theory of control', 'obligatory control', 'active voice deletion', 'standard indonesian', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2010

The main data set is constituted by the suffixal alternations of Japanese verb inflection, which have been analyzed in at least four distinct ways in the literature.  In dealing with the question of which analysis is the descriptively adequate one, I depend on the principle, due to Kiparsky, that synchronic structure constrains change, so that change can be diagnostic of structure:  in the context of a general model of the inferential relation between synchrony and diachrony in inflectional morphophonology, I compute the predictions for potential change for three analyses of the Japanese alternations and show that only one is consistent with the results of a nationwide survey of inflection.  With regard to the explanatory principles governing the choice of the descriptively adequate analysis, the overriding criterion is seen to be predictability of inflected forms (IF Predictability); I consider and reject, however, the position that speakers evaluate for IF Predictability a unitary complex of base forms and rule(s), concluding on the basis of attested or ongoing reanalyses in Portuguese and Korean that base forms are chosen first and that only then do speakers deal with the question of whether the alternation is rule-governed.  Finally, without taking a stand on the descriptive question of how much less constrained rules resulting from reanalysis are (how much ""crazier"" they can be) compared with rules (or constraints) that directly reflect the phonologization of phonetic variation, I suggest that the phonology of phonologization and the phonology of reanalysis are sharply distinct at the explanatory level--in particular, in their respective principles of base form choice.","['japanese', 'verb inflection', 'external evidence', 'descriptive adequacy', 'reanalysis', 'analogy', 'phonology', 'morphology']",2010

Three mechanisms are commonly proposed to change the order of syntactic terminal elements at the morphology/syntax interface, including head-movement, morpheme-specific prefix/suffix specification and morphological merger. Given that each mechanism is independently well-motivated, we can ask what kind of patterns we might expect to see when they co-occur. I argue that two particularly flagrant cases of Mirror Principle violations, in Cupeño and Navajo, can be accomodated within the syntacticocenric framework using just these tools, without positing any additional special word-formation mechanisms, or any additional quasi-syntactic operations.","['cupeño', 'navajo', 'merger', 'adjacency', 'polysynthesis', 'complex predicates', 'light verbs', 'morphology', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2010
Generalized x-to-C in Germanic,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001030/current.pdf?_s=zPstYQzMCZnlKeAY,"['Leu, Thomas']","The view that the clause and the noun phrase are parallel in interesting ways has a strong tradition. This paper goes a step further, making an aspect of this idea more concrete by identifying a shared morpheme, German d-. But more importantly, and here lies the focus of the paper, it extends the parallelism to include the adjectival domain. The morpheme d- is argued to spell out a certain left peripheral head indiscriminately of the nature of the lexical category head of its containing extended projection, i.e. across V, N, and A.



The study discusses primarily two grammatical alternations in Germanic. The first is that between a low and a left peripheral (V2) position of the finite verb. The second is that between definite (weak) and indefinite (strong) adjectival agreement. I argue that the two alternations are instantiations of the same underlying dichotomy, and therefore must receive analogous analyses. Notably, given that verb placement is derived by syntactic movement, sensitive to the presence of a complementizer, the adjectival inflection alternation is also analyzed as derived by syntactic movement, and is also shown to be sensitive to the presence of a ``complementizer.''



The generalization that ensues from adjectival, verbal, nominal, comparative, and historical considerations, is that there is a left peripheral head, F, in Germanic which  either attracts a low category, containing the lexical category-head of the extended projection (the verb, the adjective, or the noun), or is realized as d-. This proposal is strongly supported by the typological generalization within Germanic that embedded V2 in the presence of an overt complementizer is readily available exactly in those languages whose complementizer is not a d-word.","['germanic - verb second - adjectival agreement - complementizer - definite article - extended projection  - syntax/morphology', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2010

Cross-linguistic variation in position and complexity of case morphology is then accounted for in terms of differential noun phrase movement within the invariant sequence (Cinque 2005). I further investigate the possibility that variation in movement may be reduced to variation in the shape of the actual lexical entries. In order to implement this, the model of cyclic spell out by Starke (2009b) is adopted. In this model, each step of external merge is followed by lexical access. Consequently, evacuation movements may be triggered after each step of external merge in order for successful lexicalization to take place.",['1668 times'],2010

These predicates superficially resemble resultative secondary predicates, however it is shown that they do not modify any word in the syntax. Rather, these predicates modify the category-neutral root of the verb in a configuration which is licensed by the underlying structure of implicit creation verbs. The modification of such roots provides evidence that they are syntactically active, as proposed in the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993, Marantz 1997, Arad 2003).  It is shown that the roots are syntactically well-behaved and can be modified just like other 'larger' constituents.  Syntactic parallels between the implicit creation verbs which license pseudo-resultative predicates and other structures further provides evidence for a syntactic decomposition of these verbs whereby the object is related to the root in a prepositional structure in a manner reminiscent of proposals for other classes of verbs in Hale and Keyser (1993) and Hale and Keyser (2002).","['adjectives', 'adverbs', 'compositionality', 'distributed morphology', 'lexical decomposition', 'morphology', 'pseudo-resultatives', 'resultatives', 'roots', 'secondary predication', 'semantics', 'syntax', 'verbs', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'semantics']",2010

Most promisingly, several leading researchers considering often unrelated issues have converged on very similar solutions, lending considerable weight to the overall architecture. Details of implementation certainly vary, but the general framework has achieved almost uniform acceptance. In this paper, we recap some of the many and varied arguments for the 'split-vP' syntactic architecture which has taken over most of the functions of theta theory in the old Government and Binding framework, and consider how it can account for the central facts of argument structure and argument structure-changing operations.

Little words don’t lie: X’ have initial X0,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003605/current.pdf?_s=w1fyXP6T4rO74Vv1,"['Emonds, Joseph']","Four properties of short ‘pre-head modifiers’ in English demand attention. First, they violate the head-initial parameter setting for English phrases. Second, they cannot select complements nor undergo phrasal movement. Third, complements rather than heads receive the main stress in phrases (Nespor and Vogel 1982). But non-emphatic standard stresses in very expensive glasses, fondly described, proudly defiant and directly behind are all on the X0 heads. Fourth, most English “A-ly adverbs” in post-head or other positions alternate with non-parenthetical PP phrases such as in an A way or to an A degree. But many–ly adverbs do not alternate with such PPs. 
This paper argues that these ‘pre-head modifiers’ are in fact themselves heads which are grammatical heads (v, a, p, and n) whose complements are the traditionally termed VP, AP, PP and NP they have previously been thought to modify. The four (or five) problems above disappear. This solution leads to interesting consequences, which the paper briefly addresses,  i.e. –ly is then a late inserted inflectional head of these ‘adverbs’, which are in fact adjuncts of category A located in head positions.

Case Theory Revisited: Nominative and Accusative Super Case,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003588/current.pdf?_s=2d6BfeNvtAOXK0YO,"['Emonds, Joseph']","
Indo-European morphological case systems exhibit considerably more syncretism between nominative and accusative cases than between other pairs of cases. This reflects the fact that the two case-assigning categories for nominative and accusative, namely the finiteness constituent I and the lexical verb, are facets of the same basic category, call it simply V. That is, I = V, +I and the verb = V, –I. Assuming further that case morphemes are simply “Alternative Realizations” of the case assigners, then a nominal projection with an alternatively realized V-feature that lacks further specification as either +I (nominative) or –I (accusative) has a neutralized case, called here “Super Case”.
The paper analyses a range of morphological case regularities of Romanian, Latin,German and Czech and demonstrates show that an undifferentiated “V-case” playsa central role in these four quite different systems. Consequently, the four basic cases of Government and Binding research actually reduced to three, V-case (Super Case),N-case (genitives) and P-case (obliques, i.e. dative, ablative, instrumental, etc.).
Further, investigation shows that so-called neuter gender in Latin, German and
Czech is a name for a subset of masculine inanimate nouns which have a special relationto V-case but are otherwise regular. Lexical entries of neuter noun stems in Latinand German have an inherent V-case feature, which makes suffi xal case morphemes redundant on both Latin nouns and German singular determiners. The traditional classificatory terminology in Czech is reversed, in that its regular masculine inanimates are those traditionally terms neuters (aut- “car”, masl- “butter”). While its masculine inanimate nouns that carry an inherent V-case feature, making redundant (similar to Latin neuters) any special V-case suffixes, are those called “masculine inanimates” (hrad “castle”, most “bridge”). “castle”, most “bridge”).","['nominative', 'accusative', 'case syncretiwsm', 'german case', 'romanian case', 'czech case', 'latin case', 'neuter gender', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2010

"Definite Markers, Phi-Features, and Agreement: A Morphosyntactic Investigation of the Amharic DP",https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000946/current.pdf?_s=Ma7v2X2Q4W9GgESH,"['Kramer, Ruth']","This dissertation has two inter-related goals: (i) to describe and provide novel analyses of three types of important phenomena within Amharic DPs and (ii) to explore the properties of the syntax-morphology interface. The core phenomena explicated are the unusual distribution of the definite marker, the gender system (which relies heavily on natural/biological gender), and the plural system (which involves the relations between several distinct types of plurals). The dissertation shows how these phenomena have important ramifications for morphosyntactic cyclicity, the morphosyntactic treatment of phi-features, and the relationship between the syntax and morphology of agreement. I show that the definite marker is best accounted for in two sub-cases. When obligatory, it is a second position clitic, and when optional, it is the reflex of a definiteness agreement process. The operation that places the definite marker in second position is shown to be unable to access previous syntactic cycles, i.e., there is phase impenetrability at PF. The accounts of both gender and number explore the division of labor between little n (the nominalizing head) and the root. I argue that both natural gender and grammatical gender must be present in the syntax, and propose that grammatical gender is a feature on roots, whereas natural gender is a feature on little n. In the number domain, the differences between regular and irregular plurals (and the behavior of double plurals in Amharic) are best analyzed with two different slots for plural features: they can appear on Number, for regular plurals, and on little n, for irregular plurals. The system of gendered plurals is derived from the interaction of the gender and number features on little n. Finally, I explore the syntax and morphology of feature sharing, arguing that the plural feature is in fact shared between Number and little n, and developing an account of the morphological realization of shared features. This account correctly predicts that all the types of plurals in Amharic are synonymous yet morphologically distinct. I further generalize the feature sharing analysis of plurals to account for all cases of DP-internal agreement.",['307 times'],2009
Syntactic and Semantic Predictors of Tense in Hindi: An ERP Investigation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000889/current.pdf?_s=Pbegug26FznMaD9D,"['Dillon, Brian', 'Nevins, Andrew', 'Austin, Alison', 'Phillips, Colin']","Although there is broad agreement that many ERP components reflect error signals generated during an unexpected linguistic event, there are least two distinct aspects of the process that the ERP signals may reflect. The first is the content of an error, which is the  local discrepancy between an observed form and any expectations about upcoming forms, without any reference to why those expectations were held. The second aspect is the cause of an error, which is a context-aware analysis of why the error arose. The current  study examines the processes involved in prediction of past tense marking on verbal morphology in Hindi. This is a case where an error with the same local characteristics can arise from very different cues, one syntactic in origin (ergative case marking), and the  other semantic in origin (a past tense adverbial). Results suggest that the parser does indeed track the cause in addition to the content of errors. Despite the fact that the critical manipulation of verb tense marking was identical across cue types, the nature of the cue  led to distinct patterns of ERPs in response to anomalous verbal morphology. When verb tense was predicted based upon semantic cues, an incorrect future tense form elicited an early negativity in the 200-400 ms interval with a posterior distribution. In contrast, when  verb tense was predicted based upon morphosyntactic cues, an incorrect future tense form elicited a right-lateralized anterior negativity (RAN) during the 300-500 ms interval, as well as a P600 response with a broad distribution.","['ergative', 'hindi', 'tense', 'parsing', 'psycholinguistics', 'erp', 'p600', 'ran', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2009

referential pro, PRO, or a bound variable. Typically, the EPP is irrelevant for the reasoning because it is assumed that it is satisfied by a null subject (pro). The goal of this paper is to shift the perspective and bring the EPP into the picture. I argue that pro is not in Spec,TP. Consequently, for a null-subject structure to be grammatical, the extension requirement must be satisfied by something.

The difference between the last two groups is exemplified by the English contrast in: John is a {waiter/#prince} and Mary is too (compare #Mary is a waitress/princess, and John is too). We examine six languages, and show that nouns for nobility/titles and kinship nouns form a systematic exception to an otherwise stable marked:unmarked opposition, and that when this class of nouns is factored out, the remaining two classes reflect the inflection/derivation distinction in the morphological realization of gender.","['gender', 'markedness', 'ellipsis', 'predicative nouns', 'morphology']",2009

Lexical decomposition in modern generative grammar,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001532/current.pdf?_s=YOAcJ9Qp6oC_agbh,"['Harley, Heidi']","In the past fifteen years, lexical decomposition has become an accepted fact among syntacticians and semanticists working in the Chomskyan framework, particularly among those studying verbal argument structure, and particularly with respect to change- of-state verbs. Many of the analyses of verbal syntax and semantics that are now accepted essentially without comment are essentially modernized versions of the previously-discredited proposals of the Generative Semanticists. Progress is not retrograde, however: many of the most cogent empirical objections to the decompositional project have been answered, and there are at least some inklings of the explanations for others. The net result is that modern theories can capture many of the morphological, syntactic and semantic generalizations that motivated the original proposals in the first place, which were difficult to capture in the Lexicalist frameworks that dominated the field from the 1970s to the 1990s. The proposals also have serious scientific legs, in that they have made predictions and captured cross-linguistic generalizations that would have been impossible to contemplate without them. In this paper, I first take some time to
systematically address the status of some of the original empirical objections to the decompositional project, given a particular set of assumptions about how decomposition works in a modern framework. I then quickly survey some decompositional proposals with an eye to conveying the breadth and depth that the approach has developed.

In this paper I argue that hard conditions like legibility at the linguistic interfaces invoke simplicity metrices that, given that they stem from different mental modules, are not harmonious. I argue that widely attested expression strategies, such as agreement or movement, are a direct result of conflicting simplicity metrices, and that UG, perceived as a toolbox that shapes natural language, can be taken to consist of a limited number of markings strategies, all resulting from conflicting simplicity metrices. As such, the contents of UG follow from simplicity requirements, and therefore no longer necessitate linguistic principles, valued or unvalued, to be innately present.

Thus, I argue that what makes the syntactic constructions we call words ‘special’ (ie lexical) is that they are the smallest units of human language in which there is a direct connection between meaning and sound. It follows then that traditional morphemes (including lexical roots) lack, to use Saussure’s terms, of ‘plane of expression’, so that only 'words' would be linked with articulatory-perceptual systems.

This notion is characterized in semantic, ontological, and cognitive terms. Sorts, or nominal concepts, represent what is specifically nominal in lexical semantics. Not all nominalized properties are concepts; in particular, not transparent deverbal nominalizations. Concepts thus provide a substantive notion of nominality not coextensive with the morphosyntactic one. I present some evidence for the linguistic reality of this notion. In word formation and in phrases like plastic flower, the semantic value of a noun is its concept and not what it may be true of. The two often differ, as concepts are typically based on function and conventional expectations more than on objective properties. Concepts also seem to be needed in expressing semantic restrictions on affixation (ornamental, but *employmental). Finally, concepts are the value of nouns, not of any of their pieces; in particular, not of roots. This emerges clearly from the examination of different nouns (and verbs) sharing one root, and accords with the view that lexical categories have content, and roots are category-free.",['1278 times'],2009

My main claim is that the participial and nominalizing morphology in Swedish is semantically highly under-specified. The difference in interpretation that arises between the two participles on the one hand and the two nominalizations on the other has its base in height of attachment of the morphemes in question. However, in addition, to get the full distributional pattern and the interpretational possibilities of the participles and nominalizations one has to take into consideration the lexical specification of the verb and other ""blocking"" forms (irregular and zero-derived forms). The pattern that arises supports the more general idea that verbal semantics can be broken down into small semantic primitives in the syntax. Each of the derived forms can further give rise to a lot of interpretations (i.e., result and event interpretations for both participles and nominalizations). I argue that the different readings all derive from a single verbal entry, with the ambiguity arising from different subsets of syntactic and semantic features surfacing in the various readings.","['participles', 'nominalizations', 'swedish', 'syntax-semantics interface', 'morphology', 'the lexicon', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'semantics']",2008

The article shows that both have been invented in phonology, the former by Lexical Phonology in the early 80s, the latter by J. Kaye in the early 90s.

The interactionist character of Chomskyan phase theory affords a major break in generative interface theory. One consequence is that intermodular argumentation is now possible: the chunks that are designated by the spell-out mechanism for computation at PF must be the same on both sides. Also, the phonological and syntactic computation of these identical portions of the string must be restricted by the PIC in the same way. A particular syntactic analysis thus makes precise predictions on the phonological side, and vice-versa.

On these grounds, competing phonological analyses of affix class-based phenomena are compared. Since Lexical Phonology, the most popular solution are morpheme-specific phonologies, i.e. distinct computational systems that apply to strings according to their morphological composition (class 1 vs. class 2 affixes). An alternative that works with just one computational system has been proposed by Halle & Vergnaud (1987 et passim): the central tool is selective spell-out, i.e. the idea that only a subset of nodes (phase heads in syntactic terminology) is actually spelled out. Kaye (1992,1995) has supplemented selective spell-out with a ""freezing"" no look-back device that inhibits the modification of previously interpreted strings (this is Chomsky's PIC).

Since the PIC and morpheme-specific phonologies do the same labour in the analysis of affix class-based phenomena (they organize underapplication), no theory can afford to accommodate both: this would be redundant. If syntactic phase theory is on the right track, then, present and past solutions that rely on morpheme-specific phonologies do not qualify: the PIC must exist in phonology.

Finally, it is shown that Kaye's system also implements in phonology what is known as the phase edge in syntax (the sister of phase heads, not their maximal projection, is spelled out).","['intermodular argumentation', 'modularity', 'phase theory', 'phase impenetrability', 'pic', 'selective spell-out', 'lexical phonology', 'interactionsim', 'no look-back devices', '""freezing"" no look-back', 'modification-inhibiting no look-back', 'strict cycle condition', 'scc', 'morpheme-specific phonology', 'phasehood', 'edge of the phase', 'phase edge', 'government phonology', 'syntax', 'morphology']",2008

I solve this puzzle by recasting Kim’s (2007) analysis of Korean internally-headed relatives in a Kratzerian situation semantic framework (e.g., Kratzer 1989, 1998, 2002). The central claim is that the three ""kes""-constructions have an identical form because they all instantiate situation subordination that is facilitated by an E-type pronoun and a relativization strategy. The proposed analysis shows that E-type pronouns and relativizers can have more flexible semantics than widely assumed. It also sheds new light on the connection between modification and complementation. Furthermore, it provides an argument for Kratzerian situation semantic theory in dealing with the interpretations of complex clauses.","['e-type anaphora', 'internally-headed relative clause construction', 'direct perception construction', 'factive construction', 'kratzerian situation semantics', 'semantics', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2008

Three findings are presented, developed in the perspective of the Minimalist Program of Chomsky (1995): 

-Uninterpretable phi phenomena support the modular organization of the grammar, whereby syntax is autonomous of morphophonology (less strongly, of interpretation). 

-Person-hierarchy interactions between arguments indicate that both morphophonology and syntax are responsible for some ""uninterpretable"" phi phenomena, creating two classes with distinct properties predicted by the autonomy of syntax. 

-Certain syntactic uninterpretable phi phenomena, namely person hierarchy interactions and dependent Case, suggest that uninterpretable phi-features enter an autonomous syntax as a last-resort response to the need to converge at the interface with external systems. This makes for a potential source for uninterpretable features in general.",['1079 times'],2008
Spell out your sister!,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000800/current.pdf?_s=P2uyuZCRrPNmjqLB,"['Scheer, Tobias']","In contrast to GB where the completed morpho-syntactic derivation was merely dumped into PF and (LF) with a ""good bye and don't come back"", phase theory establishes a two-way pipe between the morpho-syntactic and the phonological (and semantic) module. Actors on both ends are not free anymore to do what they want: their theories and analyses may make predictions on the other end. Intermodular argumentation in a phase-based architecture can thus build on the logical fact that interpretational units -- the pieces which are designated for spell-out -- must be the same in morpho-syntax and in phonology. Intermodular argumentation probably provides stronger evidence than what can be produced by modular-internal reasoning: it offers the maximal degree of independent assessment that linguists can expect without leaving their discipline. The intermodular argument that is made in this paper concerns the phase edge: in current syntactic phase theory, only the complement of (the head of) the phase head is actually interpreted. In other words, the sister of X° is spelled out. Based on phonological evidence of cyclic spell-out, a number of theories have been proposed which have variable takes on how spell-out works. Among these, only one -- Kaye (1995) -- spells out the sister of interpretation-triggering affixes. The point that is made, then, is that only this phonological theory is able to offer a unified spell-out mechanism for syntactic and phonological effects of the same thing: cyclic derivation. This is how syntax can referee the competition of phonological theories. Finally, an issue is discussed that appears to stand in the way of a uniform spell-out mechanism: in syntax phasehood is a property of node labels (node-driven phase), while in phonology node labels are irrelevant: nodes inherit phasehood, which is a lexical property of affixes (piece-driven phase). It is pointed out that den Dikken's (2007) Phase Extension is a step in the direction of piece-driven phase.","['syntax', 'morphology', 'phonology', 'spell-out', 'phase edge', 'phase extension', 'phase impenetrability', 'intermodular argumentation', 'cyclic spell-out', 'node-driven phase', 'piece-driven phase']",2008

In the new analysis, LDA is the result of ordered operation application at an extremely local level conditioned by a specificity condition, the Maximize Matching Principle, which is an extension of Chomsky's (2001) Maximize Matching Effects Condition. The new analysis accounts for a number of properties of LDA: It captures the parasitic nature of the construction (matrix V can only show LDA if embedded V shows local agreement), offers a principled explanation for the non-intervening embedded external argument, accounts for the blocking of LDA in the presence of left-peripheral material, derives scope effects, and is flexible enough to account for cross-linguistic variation. The new analysis also allows for a new perspective on the relation between LDA and topicality in Tsez: I argue that LDA is not dependent on topicality, but that both the topic interpretation and LDA fall out as a side effect of V-to-I movement.","['long-distance agreement', 'cyclic agree', 'specificity', 'maximize matching principle', 'topic interpretation', 'head movement by fusion', 'tsez', 'hindi-urdu', 'belhare', 'chechen/ingush', 'chukchee', 'khwarshi', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2008

Content and exponence of roots are thus dissociated.

Finiteness and inflection: The syntax your morphology can afford,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000545/current.pdf?_s=VaNky79yntbCmEgX,"['Eide, Kristin Melum']","One objective of this paper is to argue that the lack of overt inflectional markings encoding finiteness is an important trait separating Present Day English (PDE) from modern Mainland Scandinavian languages (MSc). In contrast to previous analyses in the generative framework, our approach considers finiteness a primitive distinction explicitly expressed in verbal forms and, crucially, cutting across tense, mood, and agreement markings. Middle English (ME), like MSc, encoded finiteness; however, while MSc languages have retained the encoding of the finiteness distinction in spite of the loss of mood and agreement markings, PDE main verbs have lost this distinction (although they have tense and agreement markings). This loss leads to a range of syntactic differences between MSc and PDE, giving rise to phenomena such as do-support, different auxiliary-main verb splits, and the behaviour of subjects vs. non-subjects in root wh-clauses. Support for the analysis presented here comes from a variety of sources: dialectal usage of English preterite and participle forms, the behaviour of different English auxiliaries, the emergence of verb raising in Creoles, first and second language acquisition, and comparisons of English and MSc grammars.","['finiteness', 'tense', 'agr', 'mainland scandinavian', 'english', 'auxiliaries', 'main verbs', 'syntax']",2007

This paper argues that, together with an anti-locality constraint on movement (following Grohmann 2000, 2003) which prohibits overly local movement as elaborated in (i-v), the occurrence of a canonically left dislocated subject in anti-agreement languages accounts for all syntax peculiar to the phenomenon in the Bantu language of Kinande: (i) subjects can extract long-distance even across islands; (ii) subjects are locally unextractable if the canonical subject/verb agreement occurs; (iii) local subject extraction requires a change in subject/verb agreement morphology; (iv) objects cannot locally extract even if they appear to do so; and (v) objects can extract long-distance; however, they are sensitive to islands. Evidence comes from an analysis of the distribution of nominal expressions in the language as well as in-depth examination of two different wh-question formation strategies in the language. This study also reveals that last resort strategy in a language is relativized to what is first resort: if resumption is first resort, movement is last resort, and vice versa.

As a result, multiple Case features can be assigned to a single constituent, which permits us also to derive the behavior of predicate Case in languages with multiple predicate cases (Russian, Finnish) on the basis of some standard Distributed Morphology assumptions.

The distribution of suppletion in these forms is shown to be parasitic on suppletion in the comparative adjective. I argue that this is best understood if the superlative adjective and the change of state verb are always derived from the comparative adjective, even where this relation is not morphologically transparent. The paper also briefly considers some theoretical implications of this conclusion for morphology (in particular the formal treatment of suppletion) and semantics (the decomposition of superlatives and change of state verbs). In the course of the investigation, what may be a novel poverty-of-the-stimulus type argument is introduced. Due to the severely limited nature of the relevant data in any given language, the generalizations are not significant language-internally but only when considered from a cross-linguistic perspective.

The relevant locality condition must hold at some point in the derivation and is simple in that it does not assume extension or contraction of the relevant probing domain, unlike proposals that explain the apparent optionality of agreement in bi-clausal environments by appealing to optional restructuring {Boeckx 2004, Nomura 2005, Bhatt 2003, Bobaljik2006). More concretely, I argue that Dative intervention effects in Icelandic depend on whether the potential intervener undergoes object shift or it does not. I argue that the locus of agreement is v, whose unvalued phi-features act as a probe. If the potential intervener undergoes object shift, v is free to probe the Nominative object.

This potential variation in post-syntactic hierarchical structure gives rise to the observed surface variations, when combined with a prosodic template model of reduplication (Marantz 1982) and a cyclic view of Vocabulary Insertion under Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993). Furthermore, I illustrate in detail how both syntactic limitations and phonological output constraints (i.e. Optimality Theory, Prince and Smolensky 2004) work together to preclude ungrammatical constructions.

Minimize Exponence:  Economy Effects on the Morphosyntactic Component of the Grammar,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000514/current.pdf?_s=1DA5NbuDYe9ALtsn,"['Siddiqi, Daniel']","Working within the morphosyntactic framework of Distributed Morphology (DM, Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994) within the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995), this dissertation proposes a new economy constraint on the grammar, MINIMIZE EXPONENCE, which selects the derivation that realizes all its interpretable features with the fewest morphemes.  The purpose of this proposal is to capture the conflicting needs of the grammar to be both maximally contrastive and maximally efficient.  

	I show that the constraint MINIMIZE EXPONENCE has a number of effects on analyses of morphosyntactic phenomena.  I propose that, in order to satisfy MINIMIZE EXPONENCE, the roots in a derivation fuse with the functional heads projected above them, resulting in a simplex head that contains both a root and interpretable features.  Following the tenets of DM, this head is now a target for the process of Vocabulary insertion.  Since the target node contains both content and functional information, so too can Vocabulary Items (VIs) be specified for both types of information.  This allows VIs such as eat and ate to compete with each other.  This competition of forms linked to the same root allows for a new model of root allomorphy within the framework of DM.  In this model of root allomorphy, following proposals by Pfau (2000), VIs that realize roots participate in competition in the same was as do VIs that realize abstract morphemes.  Since root VIs are participating in competition and are specified for both content and formal features, the need for licensing through secondary exponence as proposed by Harley and Noyer (2000) is removed from the framework.  Further, since eat and ate in this model are different VIs with different specifications that compete with each other for insertion, this model of root allomorphy also eliminates the need for readjustment rules as proposed by Halle and Marantz (1993, 1994) and elaborated on by Marantz (1997).  This new model of root allomorphy allows for an account of the blocking of regular inflection in English nominal compounds (e.g. *rats-catcher), which was problematic for theorists working with DM, given the tenets of the framework.

I also show that the fusion of roots and functional elements driven by MINIMIZE EXPONENCE allows for a new account of subcategorization.  The model of subcategorization presented here falls out of the following facts:  1) arguments are introduced by functional heads; 2) those heads fuse with the root they are projected above, resulting in the node containing both the root and the features of the functional heads; 3) since the root now contains both the root and the formal features, the corresponding VI can be specified for both; 4) VIs that realize roots can also be specified for compatibility or incompatibility of the features of the functional heads that license argument structure.  The result here is an underspecification model of subcategorization that predicts a number of behaviors of verbs with respect to their argument structure that it is difficult for a full specification model to account for.  Those include polysemy (I ran the ball to Mary) and structural coercion (I thought the book to Mary).","['dm', 'stem allomorphy', 'subcategorization', 'feature blocking', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2006

Analyses of the causative have had a major influence on many foundational aspects of syntactic theory, including control, case marking, clause structure, theta-theory and argument structure, and the morphology-syntax interface. In this paper, I focus on just one aspect of the causative puzzle: In what component of the grammar are the various causatives constructed? It turns out that the answers to many of the other syntactic questions posed by causatives depend on the theoretical choices made in answering this one. The paper opens with a review of the differing implications of lexicalist and non-lexicalist analyses for the architecture of a linguistic model, and then develops the arguments of Miyagawa 1994, 1998 for a unified, Late Insertion treatment of the 'lexical' and productive variants of the causative within the syntax. The domain of attachment of the causative morpheme is argued to determine whether its interpretation must be compositional or may be idiomatic, and whether it exhibits stem-conditioned allomorphy or not.","['japanese', 'causatives', 'lexicalism', 'distributed morphology', 'blocking', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2006
Contrastive Specification of Person on Syntactic Arguments,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000167/current.pdf?_s=8LicTYOAsdO3Rh93,"['Nevins, Andrew']","In modeling the effects of the Person-Case Constraint (PCC), a common claim is that 3rd person ``is not a person"". However, while this claim does work in the syntax, it creates problems in the morphology. For example, characterizing the well-known ``spurious \textit{se} effect"" in Spanish simply cannot be done without reference to 3rd person. Inspired by alternatives to underspecification that have emerged in phonology (e.g. Calabrese 1995), a revised featural system is proposed, whereby syntactic agreement may be relativized to certain values of a feature, in particular, the contrastive and marked values. The range of variation in PCC effects is shown to emerge as a consequence of the parametric options allowed on a Probing head, whereas the representation of person remains constant across modules of the grammar and across languages.","['third person', 'spurious se', 'person case constraint', 'me lui', 'multiple agree', 'person features', 'morphology', 'syntax']",2006
The syntax of Swedish present participles - the lexical category problem,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000282/current.pdf?_s=9BdgcbSQ7wOLOXOy,"['Thurén, Camilla']","In this paper, we suggest that the properties of Swedish present participles can be accounted for if we take a syntactic approach to lexical categories in the lines of Distributed Morphology. We depart from the fact that Swedish words ending in -ande/-ende have the same denotation whether they appear attributively, predicatively, or nominally. Syntactically however, -ande/-ende-derivations appear in a multitude of functions. This suggests that the underlying syntactic structure of what appears to be the same form may differ. We argue in terms of Distributed Morphology for two Swedish present participles, one nominal ending on -ande/-ende and one true adjective ending in -ande/-ende, where  ande/-ende for the present participle cases denote imperfectivity and are licensed by an Asp head. For true adjectives, -ande/-ende are reanalysed as adjectival morphemes that denote property and are licensed by a categorial head a.","['swedish present participles', 'imperfectivity', 'lexical category', 'morphology']",2006

Three domains of finiteness: a Minimalist perspective,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000296/current.pdf?_s=6GN_pzvE1q-Ro68D,"['Adger, David']","This paper examines the role that the traditional notion of finiteness has played in analyses of clause structure and argument licensing in the development the Minimalist Program. I focus on three broad domains: the upper, middle and lower areas of clause structure which roughly correspond to the A-bar, A, and theta-positions of Government and Binding theory, and their corresponding heads, C, T and V. Following the general format of this volume, the initial sections are intended as a (selective) reading of recent work on this topic, and I use and extend the conclusions from this in the final section. 

I argue that the 'semantics' of finiteness should be divorced from subject licensing, and show that tense and agreement features are independently responsible for subject licensing, and the effects of this can be seen when the C layer is removed, truncating the clause at TP.   I provide a particularly radical case of this kind of truncation in Gaelic, where the clause can be truncated at the VP level. In this case too, though, subjects can be licensed in a way that depends on the formal features T and Agr. This strongly argues for divorcing subject licensing from the interpretable feature [finite]. 



I argue, in line with expectations, that there is no clear mapping from the traditional notion of finiteness to the categories of formal grammar. There are phenomena, and there are attempted explanations of those phenomena which are embedded within a theoretical system. Typically the terms in which the explanation is couched will be far removed from the terms in which the original phenomenon was described, and I believe this is the case for finiteness.","['finiteness', 'control', 'gaelic', 'case', 'subect licensing', 'syntax', 'semantics', 'morphology']",2006

Genitive Case in Complement Clauses and Reduced Relatives in Turkic,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001348/current.pdf?_s=_qpjTWFHIvq3TVOG,"['Aygen, Gulsat']","This paper provides a unified account of genitive-subject case licensing   in subordinate contexts of Altaic languages.  Genitive-subject clauses, previously analyzed as a manifestation of Genitive/Nominative subject conversion phenomenon in the syntactic literature, are analyzed as exceptionally case marked subjects of clauses that lack the nominative-case licensing feature, similar to the well studied accusative-subject clauses that lack tense. Genitive is licensed by the phi features of a nominal functional category external to the clause in Turkish, as suggested for other languages (Miyagawa 1993, Krause 2001, among others).  The difference between genitive and accusative case licensing is restricted to the nature of the functional category that licenses subject case, which is nominal in the former and verbal in the latter. The syntactic mechanism involved in case licensing is language and/or structure dependent. The major theoretical implications of the proposed analysis are the following: de-coupling of case-agreement and motivating covert movement as a syntactic process along with Agree and Move. Theoretically, phi features are accepted to be uninterpretable features on Tense head, which are involved in subject case licensing through motivating the movement of the subject DP to Spec TP. In previous literature on Turkish (Kornfilt 1984, 1987, 1988, 2002, 2003) and European Portuguese (Raposo 1987, 1989), agreement is accepted to be the licensing head or feature for genitive case on subjects in subordinate contexts and for nominative subjects in matrix clauses (Kornfilt 1987, 1989).

Part 2 includes concrete examples of compounds and some “traditional” classificatory attempts. Part 3 deals with all possible relations the parts of a compound can have each one with another. Extra gravity is given to the distinction between synthetic and root compounds and to problems that traditional approaches face in their analysis.

In part 5, we examine a hypothesis according to which certain complex words in Greek should be described syntactically along the lines of the transformational rule known as Head-to-Head movement. Finally, in part 6 we claim that certain inconsistencies and asymmetries shown in the system of compounds can be explained via a theory according to which Syntax and Morphology compete

The Position of Morphological Case in the Derivation,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000085/current.pdf?_s=ate-6d954DGwOlIl,"['McFadden, Thomas']","The main thesis of this dissertation is that morphological case is a purely morphological phenomenon, determined exclusively within the post-Spell-out portion of the derivation on the branch leading to PF. As such, case will depend in large part on the output of the pre-Spell-out narrow syntax, but the narrow syntax will not be able to make reference to or depend in any way on morphological case. I motivate this thesis by presenting extensive evidence that, contrary to what has been assumed since the late 1970s, morphological case is completely independent of the principles of positional DP-licensing that have been called syntactic or abstract Case. I then examine a series of syntactic phenomena which have been argued to depend crucially on morphological case. Specifically, I demonstrate that the interpretation and syntactic behavior of DPs marked with semantic and inherent cases is not due to their special case-marking. Rather, these DPs are distinguished from others by the syntactic structures in which they appear, and it is these structures that are responsible for both their special case-marking and their special syntactico-semantic behavior. I also present a series of empirical and theoretical arguments against making the syntactic processes that derive word-order freedom directly dependent within the synchronic grammar on rich morphological case-marking. I then develop a theory of morphological case-assignment, and show that the treatment of the actual morphology need make no reference to operations that are proper to the narrow syntax, either for the determination of which cases will appear or for the placement of the case-markers themselves. Finally, I reconsider syntactic Case in the light of the other results of the dissertation and explore the possibility that it could be eliminated from the theory, showing that, even for the regulation of subject positions in embedded clauses, where it is supposed to play its most important role, it offers no real insight into the distribution of DPs.

The application of such rules in the vocabulary also proves that its nature is not restricted to a repository of the mapping between morphophonological and morphosyntactic features but it is now extended to an active subcomponent participating in word formation.

The analysis I propose provides an identical syntactic treatment for two sets of environments, one of which exhibits idiosyncrasies associated with Lexical processes, and one of which does not; this raises questions concerning the applicability of a syntactic account for all of the cases in question.

I show that DM provides a simple account of the morphological systems we encounter and their interrelationship. In particular, the close relationship between these languages is reflected in their synchronic systems, but they diverge in important respects as well, and I attempt to account for these facts and how they relate to the theory. Certain theoretical issues which bear on the analysis are investigated as well, in particular the scope of impoverishment and the place of extrinsic ordering in morphology. In chapter 4, we take a closer look at the predictions of DM for morphological change and possible descriptions of diachrony from within the theory, taking examples from the internal histories described in chapters 1-3 as well as the development of Greek and Hittite from Proto-Indo-European. In particular, DM accounts for case syncretism with the devices of impoverishment and underspecification, each of which makes certain predictions about diachronic stability of morphological systems and the kinds of change which should occur.

We show that, in certain elliptical contexts, LF tolerates pronouns which cannot have been valued for certain features. A natural conclusion to draw is that this is driven by morphology: one might think that a feature will need valuing just where a value is required in order to determine PF form, and hence that if, for example, no number distinction is formally made, then no number feature needs to be valued. In fact, we will see that the reality is more complex than this, although morphology does play a role. We show that the morphological manifestation of a feature which can in some contexts have real content (such as a value of a phi-feature) does not necessarily have real content in all occurrences. Conversely, a morphologically visible feature whose value is formal in some contexts does not have only a formal value in all occurrences.

The analysis is based on two fundamental assumptions: (i) clitics do not target pre-labelled positions, but take maximal advantage of the available categorial structure; (ii) cliticization patterns are tightly dependent on the inflectional properties on the language, more specifically, on the feature content of the two functional categories, INFL and v. We show that the various asymmetries in clitic behaviour can elegantly be explained in terms of the minimalist theory of movement, combined with certain formal hypotheses about the building of phrase structure and about the relation of morphology to syntax. Relying on recent ideas about uninterpretable features, Attract and Agree, we argue that cliticization patterns can be made to follow from the strategies made available by U.G. to check the uninterpretable feature of the category INFL and from the derivational origin of the tense and person-number features. A principle, the Unselective Attract Principle, is introduced according to which an uninterpretable feature is a potential attractor for all the features which are of the same type as the one which it selectively attracts. In Romance and in Semitic, clitic phi-sets are unselectively attracted by INFL. Two additional principles, the Priority Principle and the Single Licensing Condition, insure that at some point in the derivation, a clitic can incorporate into Infl only if Infl doesn't already host an attracted inflectional morpheme. This idea holds the key for the enclisis/proclisis divide. Enclisis, i.e. clitic incorporation into Infl, is disallowed in Romance finite clauses where the uninterpretable feature of Infl selectively attracts the person-number agreement phi-set; it is legitimate in Semitic and European Portuguese finite clauses in which the same feature is checked through Agree.",['806 times'],2002

To account for this difference, a locality constraint on the interpretation of roots is postulated: the first nominal or verbal head that merges with the root serves as the immediate environment for determining its interpretation. This head forms a closed domain: any further derivation takes as its input not the root itself, but an element whose semantic (and phonological) properties have been cashed out. Word-derived words thus have access only to the words they are derived from, not to the root itself.

Morphology and word order in `creolization' and beyond,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000096/current.pdf?_s=UxkqlM_t_3bAM21H,"['Degraff, Michel']","Linguists have long posited  abnormal  (i.e.,  nongenetic ) transmission in Creole genesis, supposedly with  significant discrepancies , in opposition to  normal  (i.e.,  genetic ) transmission in  regular  language change, whereby a language is  passed down from one speaker generation to the next with changes spread more or less evenly across all parts of the language  (see, e.g., Thomason and Kaufman 1988). This is what I call  Creole Exceptionalism . In this paper, I select various patterns in morphology and word order in order to question Creole Exceptionalism. Take  discrepancies in one core domain of Creole genesis, namely VP-related morphosyntax. Are such discrepancies at all  exceptional ? I start with a sample of VP-related properties in Haitian Creole (HC) a bona  de Creole on sociohistorical grounds. I compare the morphosyntax of verbs and object pronouns in HC and in some of its major source languages. I also speculate on the development of said morphosyntax from the perspective of second- and first-language acquisition and the role of grammaticalization and reanalysis therein. This, in turn, leads me to examine various theoretical proposals on the morphology-syntax interface vis-a-vis verb and object placement in language change/creation, and to consider germane patterns in Germanic and French diachrony. I also compare the HC patterns with their counterparts from a couple of other Romance-lexifier Creoles, namely Cape Verdean Creole (lexifier: Portuguese) and Palenquero Creole (lexifier: Spanish). My conclusions are fourfold: (i) Even within a small sample of Romance-lexifier Creoles, there is no structural  Creole uniformity in the VP and its extended projections. (ii) Certain  discrepancies  in French and English diachrony seem as significant as their analogues in Creole diachrony. (iii) This paper's observations argue against the classic (e.g., Bickertonian) Pidgin-to-Creole scenarios whereby pidginization qua structural  break in transmission produces a macaronic and a xless pidgin that subsequently seeds a Creole qua ab novo creation. (iv) Similarly, there is little evidence from HC to support Lefebvre's relexification hypothesis whereby HC grammar would essentially reflect substratum grammar with the French contribution strictly limited to phonetic strings  deprived of [syntactic and semantic] features  and to word-order patterns in lexical projections only (Lefebvre 1998). The overall conclusion is that Creole languages do not constitute a well-delineated and exceptional class (i.e., there are no special diachronic processes of  creolization  and there is no distinct and uniform  Creole  typology):  creolization  and  language change  reflect processes of language development that are uniform across the species.",['1317 times'],2002

We offer directions for further analysis of reduplication that distinguish conditions on multiprecedence from other wellformedness modules without ""the emergence of the unmarked"" as a central tenet.","['occurrences', 'reduplication', 'linearization', 'copies', 'phonology', 'morphology']",2002
Phrasal clitics,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000027/current.pdf?_s=clsYqMDxanhI7gAu,"['Billings, Loren']","This study proposes an Optimality-theoretic model through which the various grammar components--semantics, syntax, the lexicon, morphology, and prosody--jointly determine the placement of clitics with a phrasal positioning domain, which is either a nominal expression or a clause. In order to render scope, such clitics must be phrase-initial. However, the morphology, carrying out subcategorization encoded in the lexicon, requires many such clitics to be suffixes. A third constraint prohibits affixation across certain syntactic boundaries. These three constraints require conflicting outputs, and cannot all be satisfied simultaneously. Depending on a particular language's constraint hierarchy, at least one constraint must be violated. Thus, a typology of clitic-placement strategies is predicted. This theory of cross-linguistic variation is based on conflicting requirements imposed by the aforementioned components of the grammar. In addition to an overview of clitic phenomena in Slavic and elsewhere, this paper demonstrates the proposed typology primarily using a clitic phenomenon in Russian in comparison to those in Tagalog and Warlpiri. In addition, these proposals make specific predictions about which kinds of clitic positioning can and cannot occur. Namely, these constraints predict an asymmetry in clitic-positioning types, excluding penultimate clisis.","['prosody', 'klavans', 'phonology', 'morphology', 'tagalog', 'semantics', 'warlpiri', 'russian', 'syntax', 'optimality theory', 'interface', 'typology', 'clitcs', 'lexicon']",2002

In contrast, Bresnan (1999b) argues that syntactic constraints do directly interact with morphological constraints, and that there is only one morphosyntactic evaluation procedure.

The most prominent current accounts (e.g., Rohrbacher's 1999 Morphology-Driven Syntax) require inspection of the internal make-up of paradigms and take overt morphological variation to be the cause of syntactic variation. A survey of the literature shows that these proposals are empirically untenable in their strong (bi-conditional) form; there are numerous cases of syntactic variation attested in the absence of corresponding morphological variation. The strongest sustainable descriptive generalization is a one-way implication from rich morphology to verb movement. Though this has been noted before, it's implications have not been adequately discussed. While lexicalist approaches could have explained a strong RAH; when faced with the weaker, one-way implication they can provide no account of why that correlation should hold, and are thus at best incomplete. That is, they provide no insight as to why there are no languages with rich morphology, but in which the finite verb remains in the VP. The particular correlations that are attested, and in particular the absence of a certain class of languages, do however follow from a theory which takes morphology to be not the cause, but rather a reflection, of syntactic structure, in line with common theorizing in morphology.

The contrast has been attributed in part to morphophonological properties, like the Latinate form of donate, and in part to semantic properties, like the fact that wash does not imply a transfer of possession (Oehrle 1976). In this paper, I propose that another constraint on verb distribution, the Target/Subject Matter (T/SM) restriction (Pesetsky 1995), also arises from a combination of morphological and semantic factors. I argue that semantic selectional restrictions rule out certain derivations that would give rise to a T/SM violation, while morphological selectional restrictions guide the pronunciation of the well-formed derivations.

The argument proceeds from an examination of Kannada ""valency-changing"" morphology, revealing that lexical properties alone cannot explain the distribution of the reflexive and causative morphemes. The analysis builds upon the conclusion of Lidz (1996, 2001c) that the Kannada ""verbal reflexive"" is best understood with respect to its relationship to causativity and not as a marker of semantic reflexivity. Moreover, given certain independently motivated assumptions about the representation of anaphora, Kannada reflexive morphology provides an argument that the morphological component takes syntactic representations as input and hence that morphological structure is an interpretation of syntactic structure, not the input to it. The resultant theory is one in which the morphological component determines, after some amount of syntactic computation, how a given syntactic representation should be pronounced.

The most prominent current accounts (e.g., Rohrbacher 1999) require inspection of the internal make-up of paradigms and take overt morphological variation to be the cause of syntactic variation. These proposals are shown here to be empirically untenable on the basis of evidence from dialect comparisons, diachronic changes, speaker variation, language-internal differences among constructions and acquisition data. In all cases, we find syntactic variation attested in the absence of corresponding morphological variation. Proposed weakenings of the RAH (drawing only a one-way implication from rich morphology to verb movement) are shown to be inconsistent with the morphology-driven approaches they claim to instantiate, or at best, incomplete. It is also noted that approaches relying on the overt marking of contrasts within a paradigm stand in conflict with results of current morphological theory. An alternative is considered that overcomes these problems. It is recognized that there are correlations between syntactic variation and morphological variation which do stand to empirical verification, and are thus to be explained. The particular correlations that are attested (and the attested domain of indeterminacy) follow from a theory which takes morphology to be not the cause, but rather a reflection, of syntactic structure, in line with standard theorizing in morphology.",['596 times'],2000

Special attention is paid to allomorphy in the highly complex agreement systems of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages. Finally, it is shown that the particular constellation of asymmetries in the allomorphy investigated follows straightforwardly from certain assumptions about the architecture of the grammar and the nature of morphology, key among which being (i) separation/late-insertion: the phonological strings we call affixes are reflections of prior, abstract derivations- morphology interprets syntactic structures, rather than feeding them, (ii) cyclicity: that this interpretive procedure (vocabulary insertion) proceeds root-outwards, and (iii) rewriting: that as morphosyntactic features are expressed by vocabulary items, those features are used up and no longer a part of the representation.",['546 times'],2000

While Hockett concentrated on Potawatomi, in later work he tried to construct a descriptive framework for Algonquian as a whole—notably in his 1966 paper ""What Algonquian is really like"". As he hints (1966:67 fn. 14a), Algonquian languages differ morphologically in some respects. The variation poses a test for the generality of particular analyses, and in this way helps us to evaluate the need to postulate a morphological engine distinct from syntax.

Placing data from Blackfoot, Plains Cree and Ojibwe beside Hockett's Potawatomi, I argue that the range of morphological variation in Algonquian is amenable to syntactic analysis, and that it poses problems for a-syntactic treatments. §1 reviews Hockett's notion of ""entity"", and §2 motivates a syntax for certain ""one-referent"" forms—the independent pronouns. §3 draws implications for the representation of agreement, and §4 extends the account to complex inflected forms (possess nouns and transitive verbs), arguing that they have three clitic-agreement positions. §5 concludes by comparing this analysis of Algonquian with a recent syntactically-based treatment of inflectional structure in Italian (Manzini & Savoia 1998).","['algonquian', 'blackfoot', 'plains cree', 'potawatomi', 'distributed morphology', 'a-morphous morphology', 'morphosyntax', 'pronouns', 'pronominal agreement', 'cliticization', 'affixation', 'xp movement', 'head-movement', 'morpheme order', 'person hierarchy', 'morphology', 'syntax']",1999

Empty nouns in Bantu locatives,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002224/current.pdf?_s=4ynUSE4YjwMxxxr4,"['Carstens, Vicki']","In this 1997 article I argued that locative phrases in many Bantu languages are headed by silent PLACE nouns meaning roughly INSIDE, SURFACE, and VICINITY. The approach was based on several factors: (i) locative phrases can appear in argument positions and control verbal agreement, (ii) they can contain expressions bearing locative concord and modifying PLACE noun semantic content, but nonetheless (iii) the overt locative markers (commonly ku, pa, and mu) fail diagnostics for nominal status.

I argued that ku, pa, and mu are gender-particular Case-markers akin to ‘of’ and other items commonly referred to as linkers, thus answering a question recently raised in Caha & Pantcheva 2014 as to why the hypothetical silent PLACE nouns in such analyses do not trigger the presence of linkers.

My analysis built on a proposal in my 1991 dissertation that so-called secondary prefixes in Bantu are noun class morphology for other silent nominal elements. For example, the Chichewa ka-mu-nda/ti-mi-nda – ‘little field/s’ bear two prefixes because ka- and ti- are number prefixes for a silent diminutive noun of a particular gender (see also Taraldsen 2013) while the inner prefixes mark the number of the diminutivized nouns. But locative class “prefixes” differ from other secondary prefixes in that, at least in some Bantu languages, they exhibit behavior characteristic of independent words (see Bresnan & Mchombo 1995). This difference is reflected in the account of the locative morphemes that I provide.

Why There are No Clitics,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001680/current.pdf?_s=rNgC3nJqTqPUBi9Z,"['Everett, Daniel']","This is a 1996 book that was originally distributed by SIL-UTA. It is an early version of a minimalist approach to pronominal allomorphy in which clitics and affixes are treated as allomorphs of pronouns. Affixes are morphological complements and clitics morphological adjuncts under this approach. Alternative analyses of some classic cases, as well as work on Yagua and Piraha, are included.","['clitics', 'phi features', 'yagua', 'piraha', 'morphology', 'syntax']",1996
Serbo-Croatian Second Position Clitic Placement and the Phonology-Syntax Interface,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/000112/current.pdf?_s=f1KpnNtjQfcAzeYb,"['Schütze, Carson T.']","I argue for the necessity of Halpern's (1992) proposed operation of Prosodic Inversion (PI), which can re-order a clitic and a potential host word in order to satisfy the clitic's need for a host in a particular direction. In Serbo-Croatian, this will allow enclitics that are clause-initial at S-structure to surface encliticized to the first prosodic word of the clause. Thus, at least some instances of 'second word' placement are not due to the syntax. However, all instances of 'second constituent' placement where the initial constituent is larger than one prosodic word are due to syntactic fronting across the fixed position of the clitics. I suggest that clitics are in Comp1 at S-structure, so that XPs that move to Spec-CP or heads that move to C0 are potential hosts for the clitics, but neither of these movements is obligatory. I propose that the level of Morphological Structure (Halle & Marantz 1993) is where lexical insertion takes place, including insertion of clitics, and that at this point a template based on morpho-syntactic features determines the order among the clitics under C0. At this point, the clitic cluster becomes a morphological constituent, taking on the prosodic subcategorization frame of each of its member elements, i.e. the need for a host word to the left. After morphological operations are complete, the S-structure tree as modified by the morphology is subject to a process of prosodic mapping that derives a hierarchical prosodic structure for the sentence from its syntactic structure; it is the resulting prosodic structure that is subsequently input to the postlexical phonology. I argue that prosodic mapping must crucially happen in two stages, the first a blind application of constituent-forming rules sensitive only to syntactic boundaries, the second a repair phase that modifies the output of the first based on prosodic requirements of the language. I claim that PI is part of this second stage, repairing sentences wherein clitics are unlicensed due to the lack of a host by performing the minimal change needed to license them, namely inverting the linear order of the clitic cluster and the following prosodic word.","['dm', 'morphology', 'syntax', 'serbo-croatian', 'serbian', 'croatian', 'bosnian']",1994
The syntax of the morphological defectivity of BE,https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003278/current.pdf?_s=b3NqDv1W-Hb-vgZK,"['Postma, Gertjan']","In this paper, it is argued that the defective and allomorphic nature of the copula (BE) is not a historical accident but derives from synchronic morphosyntactic principles. First a comparative generalization is made between the suppletive nature of the participle  of BE and its own auxiliary selection in perfect tense. It is either HAVE + BE.ptc or BE + WS.ptc, not BE + BE.ptc. (WS is an the allomoprhic root). This is derived from the Binding Theory under the assumption that BE carries an index, whose lexicalization is either pronominal or anaphoric. WS, the anaphoric root, is  composed of a pronominal part and a morpheme, just like 'zichzelf' in Dutch and 'himself' in English. A parallel is made between SE and BE.

I argue in it that Swahili N raises to D and that Bantu noun class is a morphological composite of number and gender features, where gender is lexical property of nouns and number a syntactic head. I propose that apparently derivational uses of noun class prefixes are in fact due to zero affixes with their own gender features. Adding such an affix to a noun root leads to class shift for the derived form. Hence noun class is strictly a formal inflectional feature.

I also argue that verbs bearing class 15 morphology include true infinitives, acc-ing, and poss-ing type gerunds.","['dp', 'noun phrase', 'noun-raising', 'bantu', 'swahili', 'noun class', 'syntax']",1991
